<p>
The built-in firewall can prevent unauthorized logins, and control which services can be accessed. In addition, you can choose to allow or deny access to certain network ports from specific IP addresses.</p>
<h4>To create a firewall rule:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
Click the <b>General</b>, <b>LAN 1</b>, <b>LAN 2</b> (dual LAN models only), <b>LAN</b>, <b>PPPoE</b>, or <b>Wireless Network</b> tab, depending on the type of your network connection.
</li>
<li>Click <b>Create</b>.</li>
<li>Apply the rules to specified ports by choosing any of the following in the <b>Ports</b> section:</li>
<ul>
<li>Choose <b>All</b> to apply the rules to all ports.</li>
<li>Choose <b>Select from a list of built-in applications</b>.</li>
<li>Choose <b>Custom</b> and click <b>Custom</b>, and then enter up to 15 ports separated with comma, or specify a port range.</li>
<li class="no">
You can also specify the protocols.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Allow or deny access from specified source IP addresses by choosing any of the following in the <b>Source IP</b> section:</li>
<ul>
<li>Choose <b>All</b> to allow or deny all IP addresses.</li>
<li>Enter a <b>Single host IP address</b>.</li>
<li>Enter a <b>Subnet.</b> </li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
Now you can see the created firewall rule in the rule list.
</p>
<h4>To delete firewall rules:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Uncheck the checkbox next to all firewall rules.</li>
<li>Delete all firewall rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Choose <b>Allow</b> or <b>Deny</b> in the <b>Action</b> section to allow or deny the source IP address to access the specified ports.
</p>
<ol>
<span class="note_head">Note:</span>
<li>You can create up to 100 rules for a network interface, and you can reorder the rules with drag-and-drop functionality.</li>
<li>Rules at the top will have higher priorities.</li>
<li>When you combine 2 network interfaces with link aggregation, firewall will apply the rules of the first network interface, and reserve the rules of the second network interface.</li>
<li>If your system has 2 network ports connecting to the same subnet, the firewall rules might not work properly.* </li>
</ol>
