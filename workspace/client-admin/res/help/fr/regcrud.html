<p>When a user asks for an account in the archive, he must fill a set of information. This information is then transferred to the application in the “Registers” panel. The administrator must then validate it to create a user account. 
A user account provides some special capabilities to the user:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessing to asynchronous services</li>
<li>Having its own user storage</li>
<li>Saving the user preferences</li>
<li>Accessing to restricted projects, services or datasets</li>
</ul>
<p>The “Registers” panel shows the list of user accounts waiting for a validation. The panel displays the login, first name, last name and email that the user filled during the registration step.
The administrator can delete a user account, edit his information or validate it. When a user is validated, the user information is stored in the user table and the system sends to the newly created user a confirmation email.</p>
<h2><a name="leaf_user"></a>Validate a user</h2>
<ol>
<li>Click on a row to select a user information</li>
<li>Click on <b>Validate</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A new user account is then created in the archive. A confirmation email is automatically sent to the user.</p>

<h2><a name="leaf_user"></a>Edit a user account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Find the user account by entering the last name in the search field</li> 
<li>Double click on it or click on <b>Edit</b></li>
<li>Edit the user information.</li>
</ol>

<p>The administrator can change all fields related to the user. He can also add some properties based on keyword/value. </p>

<h2><a name="leaf_user"></a>Delete a user account</h2>
<ol><li>Find the user account by entering the last name in the search field</li>
<li>click on it and click on Delete.</li>
<li>The user information will be definitively removed from the archive as well as his user space</li>
</ol>
