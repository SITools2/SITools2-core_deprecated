The optical spectra reveal absorption lines from ultra-high ionized metals (e.g. O,VIII), a phenomenon never observed before in any astronomical object.  The occurrence of such features requires temperatures in the order of 10$^6$,K, far in excess of the stellar T$_{\rm eff}$.  The asymmetric profile shapes suggest formation in a rapidly accelerating high-speed wind (10,000~km/s).  These stars represent the most convincing proof for on-going mass-loss from WDs.  We have demonstrated that a large fraction of hot WDs shows this phenomenon, concluding that perhaps {it all} WD go through this evolutionary stage.  We will study the wind properties and possible consequences for WD evolution on hand of detailed NLTE modelling.  Recently obtained medium-resolution UV (HST) and FUV (ORFEUS) spectra pose new problems.  In particular, the FUV region contains many inter-/circumstellar features which contaminate the photospheric spectrum.  Hence we ask for high-resolution high-S/N FUV spectra for a deeper insight into this mysterious phenomenon.'),('A003',1,'Phase-resolved investigation of supersoft X-ray binaries','HUTCHINGS','JOHN','Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, HIA, NRC of Canada, Canada','We propose to obtain phase-resolved $FUSE$ spectra of three supersoft X-ray binaries, achieving S/N of $sim$20 over 0.5--1.0AA in orbital phase bins of $leq$0.1P.  The emission line features in the $FUSE$ wavelength range cover a wide range of ionization giving a unique dataset for determination of the binary parameters, component masses, and disk structures which cannot be provided by optical and $HST$ data.  We will also use the combined data for each system to detect and measure high-velocity lines from bi-polar jets which are seen in the optical spectra of all three systems.  High-ionization lines from these jets are of particular interest since they are formed in the innermost region where the jets are undergoing their collimation and acceleration.  An improved understanding of jets has wide astrophysical implications.'),('A004',1,'O VI raman scattering and the geometric structure of symbiotic stars','SCHMID','HANS MARTIN','Landessternwarte Heidelberg, Germany','We propose FUSE observations of the O~VI 1032, 1038 emission line structures in symbiotic systems in order to compare them with spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations of the Raman scattered counterparts in the red spectral region.  From this we can derive the Doppler shift and polarization induced in the H$^0$ Raman scattering process.  This allows to deduce information on the geometric and dynamic structure of the red giant\'s wind region in these interacting binary systems.  In particular, our analysis should clarify the geometry of the ionization front between the cool giant and the hot component, which depends in a very sensitive way on hydrodynamical and radiative interaction processes.'),('A010',1,'The magnetic field structure of the 450 MG ultramassive white dwarf EUVE J0317-855','FERRARIO','LILIA','Astrophysical Theory Centre, Australian National University, AUS','We have recently identified the dominant features in the optical spectra of the rapidly rotating (725fs5) magnetic white dwarf EUVE~~J0317--855 with $H{alpha}$ 2s0 - 3p-1, 2s0 - 3p0 and $H{eta}$ 2s0 - 4f-1 in a magnetic field of 100-300 MG, but some features remain unidentified.  IUE data show Ly$alpha$ ${sigma^+}$ at 1300AA, and an unidentified feature near 1330 AA.  Models using centred and off-centred dipole field structures provide a reasonable fit to the averaged spectra for a dipole strength of $B_d=450$ MG displaced from the centre of the star by 35% $R_*$ and viewed at a mean angle of $30 -60gradi$ to the dipole axis.  The nature of the observed spectral variations and of the unidentified lines remains unknown.  We propose to carry out phase-dependent FUSE observations of the Lyman line series in order to resolve the field structure responsible for the observed photometric and spectroscopic variations.

FUSE spectroscopy is ideal for this purpose since the FUV allows to explore a large variety of line transitions of various elements which are not detectable in existing optical or UV spectra of the targets.  The data will be analyzed with non-LTE metal line blanketed model atmospheres.  The results will be compared to predictions from newly developed, self-consistent diffusion/radiative levitation calculations under non-LTE conditions.  The observed metal abundances will serve as bench-marks for such kind of new calculations.  As a basis for this work we have obtained high-S/N optical spectra of almost all known DO white dwarfs within the last five years as well as HST GHRS spectra of selected DO white dwarfs.  A comprehensive analysis of the atmospheric parameters is now available.  For the present proposal we have selected three targets which -- together with calibration and PI targets-- represent the non-DA white dwarf cooling sequence from the hot end down to the DB gap.'),('A019',1,'A FUSE observation of argon on Titan','GLADSTONE','RANDY','Southwest Research Institute, USA','The origin of Titan\'s thick nitrogen and methane atmosphere is a compelling enigma.  One key and still missing observable concerns the abundances of noble gases in general, and argon in particular.  Detection of argon would indicate that the N$_2$ and CO now found in the atmosphere probably came in with ice during Titan\'s accretion.  Alternatively, if there is very little argon, then we have to turn to models starting with frozen ammonia, methane and water ice, indicating a more important role for the Saturn sub-nebula, and requiring subsequent modification by photochemistry.  Current estimates on the fraction of argon in Titan\'s atmosphere are crude, and based only on indirect evidence, and range from 0--25%.  We have modeled Titan\'s expected photoelectron-generated EUV emissions with argon as an added constituent.  The bright resonance line of argon at 1048ang is predicted to be present at a level of 7--12~R, for assumed argon abundances of 5--25% in the lower atmosphere of Titan.  At a brightness of 7~R, an 80~ks integration time by FUSE would provide a $>!5sigma$ detection of argon in the atmosphere of Titan (a 30~ks integration would provide a $>!3sigma$ detection).  An accurate determination of the abundance of argon on Titan would be useful in preparing for the arrival of the {it Cassini} orbiter and {it Huygens} probe at the Saturn system.'),('A022',1,'Coronal heating during stellar flares and the search for proton beams','FISHER','GEORGE','Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California-Berkeley, USA','We will obtain high resolution FUSE spectra of the dMe star AD Leo during periods of quiescence and during flares to study the physics of atmospheric heating in flare stars.  We will also obtain coordinated ground based observations including multicolor photometry and high resolution optical spectroscopy.  Light curves obtained during flares will allow us to determine the coronal loop length and flare coverage area on the stellar surface.  The FUSE spectra will also allow us to determine the structure and evolution of temperature and density in the corona, transition region, and chromosphere, allowing us to test detailed models of flare evolution.  The unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of FUSE will strongly constrain current models.  Finally, we will search for significant red-shifted emission in the Lyman series lines of hydrogen during the rise phase of flares, possibly indicating the presence of energetic proton beams.  The existence and role of proton beams in both solar and stellar flares is currently a subject of great debate.'),('A023',1,'The FUV spectral energy distribution of star-forming galaxies','BUAT','VERONIQUE','Laboratoire d\'Astronomie Spatiale, CNRS, Marseille, France','We propose to observe several bright star-forming galaxies with FUSE.  These galaxies are selected to have been already observed in the near UV, visible and far-infrared.  The analysis of the entire spectral energy distribution longward the Lyman break will allow us to study the star formation history, the initial mass function and the effects of dust extinction in these objects.  These galaxies will constitute needful templates for the study of high redshift actively star-forming galaxies.  Under reasonable assumptions for intrinsically bright galaxies, the UV continuum (912-1200$AA$) is rather insensitive to the star formation history and the initial mass function.  Any departure from the expected flat spectrum in our sample of intrinsically bright galaxies may be attributed to the effects of internal dust and will be used to deduce an empirical attenuation curve down to the Lyman break.  The analysis of the stellar absorption lines in the far and near UV complemented with the interstellar emission lines in the optical and the overall shape of the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies will give us constraints about the recent star formation history, the initial mass function of the more massive stars and the contribution of an older underlying stellar population.'),('A024',1,'The origin of peculiar UV line ratios in magnetic cataclysmic variables','MOUCHET','MARTINE','Observatoire de Paris-Meudon, France','Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (MCV) typically show UV emission line intensity ratios broadly compatible with photo-ionization by thermal radiation of ~20-50 eV, arising from accretion onto highly magnetized white dwarfs.  However, four systems display peculiar UV line ratios not compatible with any modelling, suggesting a very peculiar ionization/ excitation process or surprising abnormal abundances which might be signs of a recent nova explosion or reflect the non-solar composition of the companion\'s atmosphere.  We propose to observe the two Polars, BY Cam (H0538+608) and V1309 Ori (RX J0515.6+0105) which both show a strong deficiency in CIV correlated with a large excess in NV.  The unprecedented sensitivity of FUSE in the 905-1195AA{} region will allow the measurement of the expected strong OVI doublet as well as several crucial C and N lines, all of which are essential to discriminate between models for the origin of the C, N emission line anomaly.  The program requests a total of {f 16} orbits (including 2 orbits for acquisition) and a total on-source exposure time of {f 28 ksec} for the two sources to obtain spectra with a spectral resolution of 0.3AA{} and a S/N ratio above 5 in the continuum allowing a detailed multi-component line profile study over several orbital phases.'),('A026',1,'Abundances of the pop II sdO stars LS IV-12.1 and ROB 162','HEBER','ULRICH','Astronomisches Institut, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany','LS IV-12.1 and ROB 162 are rare, hot (Teff=50 -- 60,000K) subdwarf O stars of population II, evolving from the asymptotic giant branch to the white dwarf domain.  FUSE spectra are proposed to determine the abundances of C,N,Si,P,S and Fe by means of NLTE model atmospheres.  In the case of ls, its high radial velocity allows the photospheric resonance lines to be separated from interstellar components.  The results of the abundance analysis will shed light on PAGB evolution in population II stars and will allow physical processes such as dredge-up of nuclearly processed matter and/or gas-dust fractionation in the AGB progenitor stars envelope to be investigated.  The [S/Fe] ratio is a sensitive tracer of the latter process.  The crucial sulphur abundance can most reliably be derived from the ion{S}{4} and ion{S}{6} lines in the FUV.'),('A034',1,'White dwarf evolution: heavy element abundances and the DA temperature scale','BARSTOW','MARTIN','Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, UK','We propose FUSE observations of a sample of the hottest known DA white dwarfs to study their evolution and the link between them and their CSPN progenitors.  Analysis of the H Lyman lines provides a unique determination of $T_{eff}$ and log g for each star, taking into account the heavy element abundances, which are known to affect the temperature determination, which we will determine from measurements of line strengths in the high resolution FUSE spectra.  Importantly, FUSE gives us access to absorption lines of several species which cannot be studied in any other wavelength range.  From this work, combined with observations of cooler PI/calibration white dwarf targets, when they appear in the public archive, we will reestablish the hot DA white dwarf temperature scale.  In addition, with significantly improved accuracy in the temperature determination we will be able to track the evolution of stellar photospheric abundance with cooling age for the first time.'),('A035',1,'The warm intragroup medium in spiral-rich groups of galaxies','MULCHAEY','JOHN','Carnegie Institution of Washington, USA','Recent ROSAT observations indicate that $sim$ 20% of nearby groups of galaxies contain a low-density, X-ray emitting intragroup medium.  If present in all groups of galaxies, the intragroup medium would be the dominant baryonic component in the local universe.  However, the ROSAT observations indicate that X-ray emission is almost exclusively restricted to groups that are dominated by elliptical and S0 galaxies.  The much more common spiral-dominated groups, such as the Local Group, are not X-ray detected.  The most likely explanation for the non-X-ray detection of spiral-rich groups is that the intragroup medium in these systems is too cool to produce detectable X-ray emission.  The intragroup medium in spiral-rich groups is expected, however, to produce detectable absorption features in the spectra of background quasars.  We propose to observe with FUSE three AGN situated behind low redshift spiral-rich groups to search for the O VI doublet in absorption, as expected from a warm intragroup medium.  The detection of O VI absorption from these groups would verify that an intragroup medium exists in all groups and is the dominant baryonic component in the local universe.  The S/N of our proposed FUSE observations are such that the failure to detect O VI in absorption would put strict limits on the presence of an intragroup medium in spiral-rich groups.  Furthermore, this limit would suggest that our current estimate for the amount of baryonic material in groups is overestimated by at least a factor of ten.'),('A036',1,'Far-ultraviolet studies of metal-deficient blue compact dwarf galaxies','THUAN','TRINH XUAN','Astronomy Department, University of Virginia, USA','How galaxies form is one of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics.  Much effort has gone into the search for primeval galaxies at high redshifts.  But these galaxies are faint and small, making their study very difficult even with the largest telescopes.  We propose here an alternative approach, the study of nearby blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies that are chemically young.  Our sample consists of 4 BCDs, two of which are among the most metal-deficient galaxies known, and which appear to be truly young, not containing stars older than $sim$100 Myr, SBS 0335--052 ($Z_odot$/41) and UGC 4483 ($Z_odot$/21).  The two other BCDs, MKN 59 ($Z_odot$/8) and MKN 71 ($Z_odot$/10), have larger metallicities and ages, and allow us to explore the far-UV properties of BCDs over a wider ange of sub-solar metallicities.  The proposed FUSE observations will allow us to investigate: 1) the H$_2$ content of BCDs.  This will directly constrain models of galaxy formation as H$_2$ is an important cooling agent in the primordial gas; and 2) the evolutionary history and stellar winds in BCDs by detecting the P Cygni profiles of high ionization lines not observed at longer wavelengths such as S VI and O VI.  The proposed observations will give us the opportunity to explore new spectroscopic techniques in the far-UV that can be later applied to the study of the star formation history in high-redshift primeval star-forming galaxies, where the far-UV is shifted to the near-UV or the optical.'),('A041',1,'Finding the onset of convection in main sequence stars','SIMON','THEODORE','Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii, USA','Main sequence A stars have both a small convective core as well as a thinconvective layer just below the visible surface.  While neither of these two regions is directly observable, convection clearly plays a key role in many aspects of A star behavior. One of the most notable of these is the formation of a high temperature chromosphere or corona.  Using FUSE, we propose to observe the far UV spectra of a sample of 8 normal A-type stars, which cover a broad range in $T_{\rm eff}$ and color index.  Our goal is to use the diagnostically important lines of O VI, which form at 300,000 K, and the density-sensitive lines of C III, which form at 60,000 K, to find the locus for the onset of convection zones, coronae, and chromospheres along the main sequence, thereby testing the predictions of stellar structure models as well as  chromospheric/coronal heating models.

We propose to exploit the unique strengths of FUSE to obtain full-resolution ($sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$) high quality (S/N $geq$ 15) spectra of the six UV-brightest starbursts.  These starbursts span ranges of 20 in metallicity (1/8 to 2.5 solar) and $sim$ 10$^2$ in luminosity.  The spectra will be used to study: 1) the coronal-phase gas that may dominate the energetics of starburst-driven `superwinds\' 2) the H$_2$ that probably dominates the ISM mass and regulates the star-formation 3) the starburst dust-attenuation law in the unexplored FUV window 4) the stellar content of the starburst (thereby probing the IMF and burst history).  These will be the finest UV spectra obtained to-date for starbursts.  In particular, the FUSE MDRS aperture allows us to obtain high-resolution spectra of nearly the entire starburst (rather than small pieces, as with HST and STIS).'),('A048',1,'FUV observations of low and high-excitation Herbig-Haro shocks','HARTIGAN','PATRICK','Dept. of Space Physics and Astronomy, Rice University, USA','We propose to test our understanding of radiative cooling behind shocks by comparing the fluxes of far-UV emission lines in stellar jets with predictions from shock models.  Our targets include the brightest examples of three distinct types of shock waves in these objects -- high-excitation, low-excitation/molecular, and preionized.  Spectra of the high-excitation bow shock HH~1F should have detectable O~VI $lambda$1035 emission if existing models are accurate.  The lack of such emission would suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in the dynamics of this object.  The unique combination of detectable H$_2$ fluorescent lines and low reddening in the low-excitation object HH~47A will allow us to measure the relative importance of molecular and atomic cooling in low-velocity shocks, and to assess the degree to which pumping by postshock Lyman $alpha$ and Lyman $eta$ photons heats the H$_2$.  A FUSE spectrum of the preionized low-excitation bow shock HH~47D will clarify how the ambient UV radiation affects emission line ratios between 900AA and 1200AA .

In particular, the halo program allows to understand how plumes generated by OB associations spread out.  A study of OVI in the halo must avoid sightlines through active regions.  This is the case for about 100 Milky Way sightlines on the reserved-target list, but only for 3 stars selected in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Since we recently used CIV absorption data to show that the LMC indeed has dex5,K halo gas, we request time with FUSE to study the global distribution of the OVI absorption in the LMC.  With these data we will asses the relationship between the dex6,K X-ray emitting gas, the dex4,K Ha maps, and the dex5,K gas.'),('A051',1,'Molecular hydrogen excitation in photodissociation regions','FEDERMAN','STEVEN','Univ.

Photodissociation regions are found around newly-formed B stars and beyond the H~{small II} regions surrounding newly-formed O stars because their ultraviolet flux is sufficient to convert molecular species into atoms.  H$_2$ is destroyed by a two step process: absorption into excited electronic states followed by radiative decay into the continuum of the ground electronic state.  This occurs with an efficiency of $sim$ 10%; the remaining decays to excited vibrational states then lead to infrared emission that returns the molecule to the vibrational ground state, but with a non-thermal distribution for the populations of high-lying rotational levels.  We will extract the gas temperature from the relative amounts in the lowest rotational levels and the flux of ultraviolet radiation permeating the gas from the amount in excited rotational levels.  The estimates for temperature and flux will lead to refined models of photodissociation regions previously based solely on infrared emission.'),('A052',1,'The Lyman continuum radiation from galaxies','DEHARVENG','JEAN-MICHEL','Laboratoire d\'Astronomie Spatiale CNRS, Marseille, France','The amount of ionizing radiation released into the intergalactic medium by star formation is a poorly known but crucial parameter.

Direct measurements are difficult and scarce.  Indirect evaluations using stellar population synthesis are plagued by the uncertainties on the Lyman continuum (Lyc) escape fraction.  We would like to take advantage of the sensitivity of FUSE down to 900 AA~ to detect (or set significant upper limit on) the Lyc radiation of nearby star-forming galaxies.

Its origin is directly related to the main energy production mechanism.  Theoretical arguments based on accretion disk models and on photoionization models suggested that the BBB peaks in the EUV.  However, recent UV observations by Zheng et al.  and soft X-ray observations by Laor et al.  suggest the FUV turns over just below 1000~AA and extends as a single power-law to $sim$1~keV.  This very surprising spectral shape has important implications for both accretion disk and photoionization models.  Since there is no overlap between the high $zsimeq 1$ UV and low $zsimeq 0.2$ soft X-ray samples, it is not clear whether the implied SED in fact holds for any individual quasar.  We propose here to obtain complete FUV coverage of a sample of 23 low $z$ PG quasars, for which high quality soft X-ray spectra are available.  The combined {em ROSAT PSPC+FUSE} spectra will allow us to set the most accurate constraints on the ionizing SED of quasars from both sides of the Galactic opacity barrier (at 912~AA-0.15~keV).  This will allow us to test directly, and in each object, whether the FUV indeed turns over below 1000~AA into a single power-law which matches the 0.15-1~keV power-law.  This sample was studied extensively and systematically in nearly all spectral bands, and highly significant correlations were found among the optical, UV and soft X-ray emission properties, providing important hints for the physical processes which shape AGN emission properties.  The {em FUSE} data will allow us to explore the expected correlations with FUV emission lines.  A few of the objects in this sample show UV and soft X-ray absorption.

Dust scattering properties in the form of wavelength-dependent values for the albedo and the phase function asymmetry will be derived with the use of Monte-Carlo multiple scattering models and with substantial reference to earlier analyses of these objects carried out at longer UV, visible, and near-IR wavelengths by the PI and his collaborators.  The results will aid in the identification of the nature of the grains responsible for the steep far-UV rise in the interstellar extinction curve, and they will provide essential input parameters for models of the far-UV diffuse galactic light and for models treating the radiative transfer in dusty galaxies.

The most powerful test of this model would be the detection of cooling gas at $sim10^{5.5}$ K, when it has lost more than 90% of it thermal energy.  OVI emitting gas is produced in this temperature range and the predicted luminosity is high enough that this gas should be easily observable by FUSE with the LWRS aperture.

The selected star, HD 34078 (AE Aur) moves at a transverse velocity of 103 km/s and the spectra taken during cycle 1 at three distinct epochs separated by 3-4 months will allow to sample adjacent lines of sight distant by $simeq$ 5 AU at the cloud distance.  The spectral range covered by FUSE is very well suited to conduct a coordinated search for small amplitude fluctuations of the column density for molecules (H$_2$, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, ...), atoms (CI, SI, ...) and ions (SiII, CII, FeII, ...).  By performing a detailed comparison of the absorption lines detected in the three successive spectra, we expect to significantly improve the characterization of the ubiquitous AU-scale structure in the ISM and better understand its nature and origin.  The properties of the proposed source as well as those of the interstellar gas along the line of sight are well characterized by previous observations (IUE, high resolution optical spectroscopy), which makes HD 34078 an ideal target for this project.  Depending on the results obtained from cycle 1 observations, we will propose to extend the monitoring of the absorption lines during cycle 2 and/or 3, especially in order to investigate the variability on larger scales (l $simeq$ 30 - 50 AU).  If no variations are detected among cycle 1 spectra, the observations proposed will at least permit a detailed study of a well documented line of sight.

We intend to study dynamics of the lower layers of the stellar atmospheres by investigating line shifts, line asymmetries, and line broadenings that we presume are related to chromospheric evaporation by high-energy processes identified in the overlying corona.  Emission measure and temperature analysis will allow us to obtain a complete 3-D atmospheric model of active regions that we will link to the previously obtained coronal X-ray data.  We will infer transition region pressures through the powerful density-sensitive ratio of the C~III 977AA/1176AA lines; this important diagnostic will be adequate to identify and model the relevant magnetic structures based on the solar analogy, and, together with our coronal X-ray (ROSAT, ASCA, SAX), EUV (EUVE), and TR (IUE/HST) data, to infer the importance of coronal energy releases.  Our FUSE investigation is central to the understanding of the evolution of magneto-dynamic atmospheric phenomena, and the associated high-energy emissions in the Sun and in solar-type stars.  It also bears on the question of the young Sun\'s influence on the developing planetary system.  The FUSE observations will further be used to estimate the important D/H ratio along the sightlines to the stars, and to search for the presence of stellar analogs to the solar wind.

Instead, for most PNe the ionized gas is merely the innermost zone of a massive, mostly neutral, circumstellar envelope.  These neutral/molecular envelopes have been studied by the PI and her collaborators via fluorescently-pumped near-infrared H$_2$ emission lines, far-infrared emission lines such as [O I] 63 $mu$m, and, most recently, optical Na I absorption lines.  We propose to use FUSE to obtain high-resolution spectra of the central stars, using their continua as backdrops for observing UV absorption lines of key neutral and molecular species, in order to determine excitation temperatures, column densities, and other properties of these envelopes.  This study will connect tightly to existing and future optical and infrared observations, as well as to previous GRHS and upcoming STIS programs.  The FUSE observations are particularly important because {it only} with FUSE will it be possible to directly observe the H$_2$ Lyman and Werner bands, the very lines that pump the cascade that produces the infrared H$_2$ lines.  With their high-surface-brightness infrared line emission, PNe provide a remarkable opportunity for tying together the absorption and emission components of the H$_2$ fluorescence process, now known to be widespread in the ISM.  FUSE will also enable us to measure the populations of the fine-structure levels of the $^3$P ground state of O I and connect these to far-infrared line observations by the PI of [O I] 63 $mu$m, the primary coolant for the warm atomic gas in PNe, and [O I] 145 $mu$m.  In addition, FUSE will sample lines of other species such as C I and Cl I, as well as revealing new spectral features from the central stars.

We concentrate on M33, whose combination of proximity and star-forming rate makes it especially amenable for this comparison.  The S/N requirements are designed to allow separation of the lines in the Lyman $eta$/O VI/C II blend which are diagnostic of the massive-star mix (particularly unevolved versus evolved stars), which has proven very difficult to unravel at longer wavelengths.  Comparing the two data sets will tell whether the brightest star-forming regions are representative of the overall FUV-emitting population, and will be used to search for scattering effects.

The hot stars responsible for the ``UV upturn\'\' phenomenon are key indicators of age and abundance in ellipticals.

This observation will also allow studying the far UV spectrum of Mars with an unprecendented quality.  H$_2$ is probably the most abundant species which has not been observed on Mars.  Photochemical models predict its mixing ratio from 7 to 50 ppm.  The upper limit to the H$_2$ density of $1.1	imes 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ at the altitude of 560 km was established using the Mariner 9 ultraviolet spectrometer observations.  This limit is very close to the value which is required to explain the densities of atomic hydrogen observed with Mariner 6, 7, and 9.  A spectrum of Mars observed with the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope does not show H$_2$ emissions.  This may raise a problem of a H$_2$ deficit on Mars, and a possible detection with FUSE may be of crucial importance.  The most sensitive method for spectroscopic detection of H$_2$ is observations of the P1 (6-v\'\') lines of the H$_2$ Lyman band system.  These lines are much stronger than other H$_2$ lines due to their excitation by the solar Lyman-beta line, the effect discovered by one of us (PDF) twenty five years ago.  However, the expected intensities are low, a few tenths of rayleigh, even for these lines.  The unique sensitivity and resolution of FUSE will allow detection of H$_2$ in the upper atmosphere of Mars.  Extrapolation of the measured abundance to the lower atmosphere will result in the H$_2$ mixing ratio with an uncertainty of 30%.  Thus, H$_2$ can be measured for the first time on Mars, and FUSE can provide a key measurement which was impossible for the numerous spacecraft that visited Mars.'),('A093',1,'FUSE observations of galactic and LMC novae in outburst','SHORE','STEVEN','Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Indiana University South Bend, USA','We propose target of opportunity observations of classical novae in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud in the early stages of outburst.

This is important since the line ratios then potentially provide a way to infer shape of the continuum in the unobservable EUV wavelength range.  It was suspected that the ratio of ion{O}{6} to Ly$alpha$ should be especially sensitive to this shape: ion{O}{6} should be strong when the continuum in the optical--UV--soft X-ray range is hard.  Among the recently presented observational evidence lending support for this idea are the {it HUT} spectra showing that some Seyfert 1 galaxies with strong X-ray soft excesses have also strong ion{O}{6} lines.  The Seyfert 1 galaxy RE~1034+38 has a remarkable spectral energy distribution. Its optical and UV spectra are very red, but there is no evidence for absorption.

The FUV photoionization flux was previously {it unknown}, but FUSE spectra can unlock the wealth of information from early optical studies of Ca~II.

However only nighttime surface densities could be measured due to daytime outgassing from spacecraft hardware.  Furthermore, due to the nature of the Apollo measurements, the spatial distribution of the most abundant known atmospheric species, Ar and He, could not be measured.  In December 1996, the 1048 AA resonance scattering line of Ar was detected at the 3$sigma$ level above the lunar dayside for the first time using the ORFEUS SPAS II satellite (Flynn 1998).  Due to the faintness of the Ar signal, and due to the insensitivity (relative to FUSE) of ORFEUS, no spatial information could be extracted from the data.  Modeling the atmosphere as an optically thin 400~K barometric distribution indicates an Ar abundance surprisingly $sim500	imes$ greater than the theoretical daytime value (Hodges et al. 1974), which may indicate that the atmosphere is actually optically thick.  A measurement of the radial distribution of the 1048 AA emission would not only provide valuable information on the Ar source but also indicate whether or not the atmosphere is optically thick.

Our detection of high-velocity absorption line C~I at +90 to +130 km/s with IUE toward a narrow region interior to the Vela SNR strongly suggests the Vela supernova remnant is interacting with a dense ISM or molecular cloud.  The shock/dense cloud interface is suggested by (1) the rarity of detection of high-velocity C~I seen in IUE spectra, (2) its very limited spatial distribution in the remnant, and (3) a marked decrease in X-ray emission in the region immediately west of the position of these stars where one also finds a 100 micron emission ridge in IRAS images.  We would like to investigate the shock physics and general properties of this interaction region through a focussed UV absorption line study using FUSE spectra.

The spatial resolution (close to HST) and the sensitivity of FUSE provide us with the only means of mapping the radial distribution of the electron temperature, and measuring the far-UV line flux data needed to uniquely determine the excitation mechanism.

The presence of these ultra-high ionization species signifies temperatures far in excess of the stellar photospheres.  Speculation provides two possible explanations for the ultra-high ionization features.  First, uncertain wavelengths for the detected absorption suggest slight blue-shifts and that these features are formed in shocks at the base of the wind.  Alternately, the simultaneous appearance of ultra-high ionization and lower ionization photospheric absorption might imply the stars are partially covered by \"hot spots\", which produce the ultra-high ionization features.

In addition, the H atom motions are modified by charge exchange collisions with fast protons in the heliospheric interface region, while He atoms are little affected by charge exchange.  Recent observations of the He and H flows in the solar system suggest that the He velocity of 26kms is that of the local ISM cloud, while the lower H velocity of 18-21kms and greatly increased velocity dispersion in the flow direction are due to an interface modification of the H flow.  Remote observations of the H flow thereby provide a method to remotely study the heliospheric interface.  The H flow has been studied from H {lya} line profiles at high spectral resolution observed by Copernicus, IUE, and HST, using the Earth orbital motion to Doppler shift the ISM from the geocoronal emission.  One serious ambiguity in the interpretation of these data results from the optically thick {lya} emission, leading to uncertainties in derived values of the H density.  Using FUSE to observe the brightness and line profile of the optically thin H lyb line, close in time to SOHO observations of the {lya} emission, we can determine accurately the optical depth and density n(H) along lines of sight upwind, downwind, and cross-flow.  Comparing n(H) with the heliospheric helium density, and with the interstellar cloud HI/HeI ratio measured recently by the EUVE, will give the fraction of H atoms removed by charge exchange at the entrance to the heliosphere, and then the Local Cloud (or ambient ISM) electron density which governs the size of the heliosphere.

Once thought to be relatedto CVs or LMXBs, it is now suggested to be a colliding wind system. If so, with its 12.3 hr period, it is the shortest orbital period colliding wind system known. It appears to be undergoing a short-lived phase of evolution, and may be in the very final stages of common envelope evolution.  VSge shows high and low photometric states, possibly related to its evolutionary state, in which the spectroscopic behaviour changes dramatically.  High resolution, phase-resolved UV spectra have been studied previously in the low state but no such observations exist for the high state and there are no published observations in the FUSE FUV wavelength range.  Still-unexplained phenomena occur in VSge which need to be investigated before the colliding wind model can be firmly established, including the mechanism causing the high and low states.  We speculate that this mechanism is related to a change in wind behaviour but this idea needs to be tested by observing and modeling the wind line profiles around the binary orbit in both states.  We therefore propose to obtain orbital phase-resolved FUSE spectra of VSge in two epochs.  With its rich spectrum of wind emission lines at a variety of abundances and ionization states, FUSE will allow us to model the structure and kinematics of the stellar winds and the shock front in the binary and probe a new regime of stellar wind collisions in evolved close binary systems.'),('B045',2,'Far-Ultraviolet Spectra of a Supernova to be Named Later','KIRSHNER','ROBERT P.','Harvard University','We propose using FUSE to observe a newly-discovered supernova duringCycle2 as a target of opportunity.

With FUSE, we can explore a previously unobserved part of the spectrum where many important lines will help in building a complete picture, especially of circumstellar interactions.  The resolution of FUSE is excellent for this purpose because it neatly separates circumstellar features from interstellar lines and the ability to move promptly to a good target is a very large advantage over HST.  A recent example of a typeII, SN 1998S, illustrates what a STIS spectrum can (and cannot) do, and gives us a solid basis for predicting what is required for measurements with FUSE.  We hope to continue our HST Target-of-Opportunity program, and we would aim to combine our FUSE observations both with our ground-based data and with STIS data.

The seemingly ubiquitous existence of such small, dense pockets of gas in the diffuse ISM is an important puzzle since the inferred over-pressures of these clumps imply lifetimes of only a few thousand years before they should diffuse away.  Measurements and comparisons of the interstellar absorption line profiles towards members of resolvable binary star systems with FUSE can greatly expand our knowledge of the physical conditions and abundances in these clumps.  Therefore, we propose to obtain FUSE observations of the interstellar H_2 absorption lines towards six members of three multiple star systems of varying separations with the goal of deriving accurate densities, temperatures, and radiation fields for the clouds associated with the observed small-scale structures in these sightlines.  By using the many lines of H_2, we can determine if these clumps are indeed as dense as they appear and discriminate between competing models for the origin of these features.'),('B047',2,'Accretion Onto Magnetic White Dwarfs','SZKODY','PAULA','University of Washington','We will observe the far UV emission of the highest field (230 MG)magnetic cataclysmic variable AR UMa and of the typical field (30 MG) polar VV Pup in order to confront theories of buried shocks and accretion heating.

In VV Pup, the ability to directly view the white dwarf, combined with a simple geometry where the primary pole rotates behind the white dwarf for part of its short orbital period, allows a clear separation of the contributions of the unheatedheated white dwarf and the accretion funnel.  The high resolution and large excitation range of lines covered by FUSE allows the delineation of the composition, temperature, density and velocity of the line-forming regions in the accretion funnel and at the photosphere of the white dwarf.

The cause of these peculiarities is controversial, with possibilities ranging from mass transfer stream impact and overflow at high mass transfer rates to magnetic propellers, winds and jets.  As many of these suggestions depend on the inclination of the system, we propose to confront such theories by contrasting FUSE observations of the low inclination SW Sex star LS Peg and a more typical high inclination system DW UMa. The high quality, high resolution FUSE spectra we will obtain will allow us to construct detailed models of the inner accretion disk and velocity flows of both systems.

The presence of these emissions at the predicted brightnesses would provide unambiguous evidence that charge exchange of solar wind ions with cometary neutrals is the dominant source of x-rays in comets. FUSE is the only observatory with sufficient spectral resolution and sensitivity to detect these faint line emissions. If the comet has V <= 5, we also propose searching for the Ly-beta lines of D and H, as the deuterium abundance is an important indicator of cometary formation conditions.

This peculiar abundance pattern bears the signature of diffusive equilibrium supplied by accretion from a close red dwarf companion. Additional evidence for the accretion scenario emerged with the discovery of V471 Tau-like EUV variability in EUVE J0720--317 and J1016--053, which suggests abundance inhomogeneities across the stellar surface.  We propose to obtain high quality FUSE spectra of these three binaries and secure abundance measurements of He, C, Si, P, and S.  The data will enable a study of the distinctive roles played by accretion and selective radiation pressure. Because selective radiation pressure on He and Si is inefficient, their abundance is determined by steady-state equilibrium between the accretion flow and downward diffusion and holds a ratio of log(SiHe)-3.7, while the abundance of C, P, and S should be determined by radiation pressure correlated with effective temperature.

Importantly, FUSE gives us access to absorption lines of several species which cannot be studied in any other wavelength range. From this work, combined with observations of a smaller number of related PI targets, when they appear in the public archive, we will re-establish the temperature scale for these stars and compare their compositions with their supposed white dwarf descendants.

This is particularly important for species which cannot be detected in any other wavelength range.  With the improved accuracy of self-consistent determinations of elemental abundances and T_eff we will be able to compare the compositions with the CSPN and DA white dwarfs.

It originates in a population of hot evolved stars that are only well-isolated in the far-UV. In quiescent elliptical galaxies, the UV optical flux ratio correlates strongly with the optically-determined metallicity of the cool stars.

With these spectra, we will make comparisons (1) between Lyman flux (and possibly H_2 emission) variability and the variability in the UV emission lines and hydrogen Balmer lines using previously obtained HST HRS, IUE, and ground-based optical spectra at coincident phases to the FUSE observations to study the effect that the radiation field from the lower, hotter shocks (where Mg 2 and the Balmer lines form) have on the upper shocked region (where the Lyman lines form), and (2) to synthetic spectra from representative dynamic models we have generated.  These NLTE radiative transfer calculations have shown that the radiation field of the inner shocks dominate the ionization throughout the entire atmosphere.  The calculations also have shown that the Lyman emission lines form in the outer reaches of the atmosphere where the shocks are much weaker as they propagate outward.  This is the first time such a diagnostic has been measured for the outer atmosphere of these stars.  It also gives us a pioneering attempt to record the suspected strong FUV H_2 in emission.  Such an observation will have strong constraints on the atmospheric structure of the outer layers of these stars.  Finally, it is imperative to obtain fairly high dispersion (R approx 10,000) spectra of the Lyman lines in Miras, since these lines are fundamental in the understanding of the energy flow in their outer atmosphere, and of mass loss in this critical stage of a stars evolution.'),('B085',2,'beta Pic-like Circumstellar Gas Disk Around 2 And','CHENG','K.-P.','California State University, Fullerton','Ultraviolet observations of 2Andromedae with the Goddard HighResolution Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HSTGHRS) clearly reveal the existence of circumstellar gas as well as the interstellar gas along the line-of-sight toward this nearby star.

Therefore, we cannot test whether the apparent reduction in molecular fraction is due to reduced formation rates, high radiative destruction rates, or selection effects. We propose observations of 7 LMC stars and 2 SMC stars with E(B--V) 0.20 -- 0.42, which will allow us to test cloud models that incorporate different assumptions about the formation rate of h2 as a function of metallicity.

The most promising explanation for this behavior is that NLS1s have a higher accretion rate with respect to Eddington.  This result is fundamental, since accretion is thought to be the ultimate power source for all AGN.  Our recent HST spectra from two NLS1s reveal unusual UV emission line properties.  The high-ionization lines are broad and strongly blueshifted, in contrast with the low-ionization lines which are narrow, centered at zero velocity, and symmetric.  The most plausible explanation is that the high-ionization lines are emitted by a wind and the low-ionization lines are emitted by a disk. Such models have been discussed previously, but our spectra provide perhaps the strongest evidence to support these models to date.  We now seek to understand the geometry and physical conditions in the wind.  The proposed FUSE observations of two NLS1s, 1H0707-495 and IRAS13224-3809, will allow us to examine the profile of the high ionization resonance line ionO6lambda1034.  This line is typically emitted in material with higher ionization parameter than the lines observed in our HST spectra and thus comparison of the O 6 and ion C 4 line profiles will allow us to distinguish between classes of models that do and do not predict ionization stratification.

Furthermore, there appears to exist a one-to-one correspondence between the presence of the warm X-ray absorber and intrinsic absorption in the UV. However, the UV absorption often arises in multiple components some of which may be lower column density and lower ionization. The far-UV bandpass of FUSE provides a critical tool for understanding the nature and origin of this gas.  The high spectral resolution of FUSE permits the isolation of multiple kinematic components in the absorption spectrum of O,VI facilitating the association of an UV absorber with its X-ray counterpart. Furthermore, O,VI is critical for establishing the connection between the lower ionization lines of C,IV and N,V seen in the UV with the high ionization absorption edges of O,VII and O,VIII seen in the X-ray.  We propose to examine the near-nuclear gaseous environment of NGC,4593 by obtaining near-simultaneous observations of this target in the UV (HSTSTIS), far-UV (FUSE) and X-ray (XMM).  We have been granted time with both HSTSTIS and XMM for contemporaneous observation of this target.

This very massive stellar system may harbor clues to the final evolutionary stages of massive stars before the supernova event, possibly even a Gamma Ray Burster event. Some have suggested that we may gain insight to the proposed very massive stars that likely formed of hydrogen and helium in the early Universe, perhaps before the first galaxies.  We have considerable motivation to understand the physics of Eta Carinae and its ejecta. Systematic studies with HST/STIS since 1998.0, the time of the last minimum, have demonstrated that excitation and ionization of ejecta close to the central star(s) drop during the minimum, but return over the next year. Emission lines of doubly-ionized Fe, N, Ne, Si, and Ar disappear; Lyman alpha-pumped Fe II lines weaken, but Mid-UV and NUV continuum-pumped Fe II lines actually brighten! FUV radiation from the central source(s) is thought to drive this system. Attempts to model the central source as a single massive P-Cygni star have failed. Models of the X-Ray emission suggest wind-wind collisions of a binary star system with the companion being an early O-star!  Recently we have determined that the apparent FUSE P-Cygni profiles are actually multiple absorption components from ejecta, not the stellar wind. During Cycle 4 we propose to observe the FUV spectrum directly, and monitor its changes across the minimum that influence the NUV, visible and near-red spectrum. These observations would be coordinated with Hubble Treasury and CHANDRA proposals already accepted for the upcoming minimum.

A study of the fluorescent patterns reveals the shape of the intrinsic H Ly alpha radiation field which is otherwise not directly observable because of attenuation by the ISM, and also provides clues to the inhomogeneous structure of stellar chromospheres.

However, Betelgeuse is the only M supergiant that has been observed and alpha_1 Her fills an important gap in stellar parameter space of Teff, surface gravity and mass-loss rate. The proposed observation will help determine whether the fluorescence observed in Betelgeuse is a result of additional scattering in the overlying massive wind, or that the nature of the inhomogeneities in the stellar chromospheres does not follow simple trends in stellar parameters, but is instead related to the specific nature of chromospheric heating.'),('D013',4,'Volatile Abundances, D/H Ratio, and X-ray Emission in Bright Comets','Weaver','','The Johns Hopkins University',''),('D014',4,'Interstellar Fluorine Via the Nu Process','Federman','','University of Toledo',''),('D015',4,'The distance to high-velocity O VI absorption in the Galactic halo','Keenan','','Queen\'s University of Belfast','Previous FUSE studies have revealed the presence of large amounts of high-velocity ($mid$V$_{LSR}$$mid$ $>$ 100kms) hot gas towards Galactic halo sightlines, detected via ion{O}{6} absorption lines in high-velocity clouds (HVCs).

A FUSE spectrum of HD 37903 obtained 20 months after the STIS observations and recently made publicly available in the FUSE data archive reveals excited H2 lines that are appreciably weaker than one would expect from the STIS data.

The planet may have survived a common envelope phase and has even gained mass. A recent spectral analysis of the primary based on high-resolution CASPEC and IUE spectra was hampered by the relatively long exposure times (1h and 2 -- 3h, respectively) and hence, a relatively large orbital velocity coverage. We propose high-resolution and high-SN spectroscopy with FUSE in order to determine precisely the photospheric metal abundances of the primary. The relatively short exposure time (10 * 200 sec) and the much better S/N ratio in the co-added spectrum at a higher resolution will reduce the error range in the abundance ratios by a factor of ten. Moreover, the high resolution allows to identify individual iron an nickel lines in the spectrum and thus, the iron/nickel abundance ratio can be analyzed. Since there still exists a discrepancy between the resulting stellar parameters from spectral analysis and those derived from the radial-velocity and the eclipse curves, the evaluation of the higher members of the Lyman series will additionally improve the determination of the surface gravity which should solve this problem. Moreover, from the comparison to evolutionary models we can derive the mass of the primary and derive the mass of the secondary, which is a candidate for the first planet found as a by-product of spectral analysis by means of NLTE model atmospheres.'),('D026',4,'Characterizing the generation of O VI ions in a hot-cold interface','Andersson','','The Johns Hopkins University','Five times ionized oxygen, OVI, is an important diagnostic of the interstellar  medium (ISM) in both the Galaxy and in extragalactic environments, where it  traces gas transitioning between hot and cool states.

In the first class, the most abundant gas is H_2; in the second, it appears  that the H_2 gas has disappeared, possibly through incorporation into gas  giant planets.  The lifetime of H_2 gas in a CS disk is therefore of great  importance, as it dictates the timescale for the formation of giant planets.FUSE observations of H_2 in CS disk systems have shown that FUV absorption  spectroscopy may sensitively probe for small amounts of gas along the line  of sight to the star.  Most importantly, the FUSE non-detection of H_2 gas  in the Beta Pictoris disk suggests that the primordial gas lifetime is less  than about 12 Myr, and that gas giant planets must form very quickly.  However, this suggestion is based on one system, and needs to be tested in  additional systems with a range of ages, especially since there are  indications that age is not the only factor in the evolution of a CS disk. We propose for FUSE observations of 3 additional debris disk systems, Fomalhaut, HD3003, and HD2884.  Fomalhaut is an intermediate age debris  disk, one of the Fabulous Four CS disks first discovered in 1984.  The  other two disks are younger, with ages similar to that of Beta Pic. All three stars are brighter in the FUV than Beta Pic, permitting us to sensitively probe for traces of H_2 gas.

The FUSE spectra provide a measurement of Teff, log g, L_bol, abundances, wind velocity and mass loss rate for these post-AGB stars. These parameters are needed to model the nebular dynamics and evolution, and constrain post-AGB evolution at low metallicity. Theoretically, metallicity affects several aspects of the post-AGB evolution, including mass loss and the yield of processed material, important factors in the chemical evolution of galaxies.  Therefore, it is very important to observe PNe in different environments. Results for Milky Way, LMC and SMC CSPNe (combining our observations from previous cycles) will be compared with detailed post-AGB calculations. The brightest (but cooler) LMC CSPNe were observed in Cycle 2.  The successful observations and results so far support our request to complete the sample of such objects accessible to the FUSE sensitivity, observing the LMC CSPNe with highest temperatures. The FUSE data are a unique contribution to constrain the properties of these objects, which are effectively at a single, unambiguous distance.

Such a gap has not been seen in any other supernova remnant shock, and is most likely the consequence of the physics of bow shock dynamics.  The region, in between optical and X-ray emitting gas and therefore likely to have intermediate properties is best explored in the far-ultraviolet.

A spectral analysis of the hydrogen and helium lines place the star below the EHB. HD188112 was found to be radial velocity (RV) variable and the RV curve has been measured to be perfectly sinusoidal with a period of 0.606585 days and a semi-amplitude of 188.3 kms, indicating that it is a close binary system. From the atmospheric parameters and the Hipparcos parallax we conclude that the mass of the sdB star is too low (0.24,Msolar) to sustain core helium burning and it is now evolving into a helium core white dwarf. A lower limit to the mass of its unseen companion of 0.73,Msolar is derived from the mass function. Because the companion does not contribute to the spectral energy distribution from the UV to the infrared it cannot be a main sequence star but must be a white dwarf (WD), a neutron star (NS) or a black hole. Because of the large companion mass, HD188112 is a crucial system to test the double degenerate scenario for progenitors of SN Ia (sdB+WD). Due to gravitational wave emission it will merge and explode if its total mass is above the Chandrasekhar limit (1.4,Msolar). It may also be a post-supernova (sdB+NS) if the companion mass is above that limit. An estimate of the inclination angle is crucial to better constrain the companion mass.

This cool enigmatic star became recently very active with a tremendous outburst event in the fall of 2000. During the event we directly observed the largest mass-loss rate (sim0.05  M_, yr^-1) in any stellar object so far (Lobel et al. 2003, ApJ, 583, 923).  Over the past two years since the eruption we observed a very prominent inverse P Cygni profile in Halpha, signaling a strong collapse of the upper atmosphere, also observed before the 2000 outburst.  Our continuous spectroscopic monitoring reveals that the Halpha line profile has transformed into a P Cygni profile over the past five months, presently signaling supersonic expansion velocities up to sim120 km,s^-1 in the upper atmosphere, similar as in the 2000 event. The fast atmospheric expansion is expected to continue over the coming year based on our recent monitoring.  We propose to observe the pumped Fesc ii emission lines at lambda1119 and lambda1124 to investigate their detailed line shapes using the high spectral resolution of FUSE. These line profiles will provide important clues about the wind acceleration mechanism in rho Cas during the exceptionally fast atmospheric expansion in Cycle 5. As the hypergiant changes spectral type from late F to G-K (or even early M), the Fesc ii emission lines are expected to reveal peculiar asymmetric shapes.  These profiles are observed in the smaller G-type supergiant alpha Aqr, but cannot provide direct evidence that its wind velocity structure is in fact accelerating outwards. FUSE observations of asymmetric FUV Fesc ii emission profiles in rho Cas will directly reveal if the wind velocity structure globally accelerates outwards in this cool star, or whether it is determined by the local gas dynamics that drives the fast expansion.

Such absorption could arise from the predicted hot phase of the IGM (the missing baryons) or from distant analogs of the high-velocity clouds (HVCs) seen near the Galaxy and Local Group.  Theory predicts that 30 - 40 percent of low-z baryons reside in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM; 10^5 - 10^7K), but only sim 10 percent have been found. Because galaxy groups are common, occupy a small fraction of space, and have been predicted to hold intragroup gas at temperatures just right for the WHIM, they are excellent places to look for the missing baryons.  We will also address the origins of OVI-bearing HVCs seen with FUSE, by complementing the FUSE survey of HVC OVI with multiple probes of galaxy groups along chordal sightlines.  Our approach maximizes scientific return by searching for absorption in groups identified in the SDSS.  Prior knowledge of galaxy group coincidences improves search efficiency because the number of such pairings varies widely between sightlines.  Our targets are chosen to maximize the number of groups that can be observed within a lesssim 200 ksec program.

Despite these important differences, it has been suggested that the driving mechanism operating in the long-period variables is the same as that thought to operate in the EC 14026 stars driving is linked to the opacity bump associated with a local enhancement of the iron abundance in the envelope brought about by radiative forces on that element.

The targets have the same (B-V)_o and v sini values as some of the observed Hyades F stars. By comparing these observations we will separate the dependence of transition layer heating on age from the dependence on rotation rate. This has not been possible with field star observations, since the stellar rotation rates decrease as the stars age. Our previous FUSE and HST observations of the Hyades F stars have indicated the presence of at least two heating mechanisms. The first dominates in early F stars and increases with increasing v sini. The second dominates in late F stars and appears to be almost independent of rotation.  These findings are surprising since the older field stars seemed to indicate that the heating in the early F stars is independent of rotation, while the heating increases with rotation in the later type stars). The OVI and C III line profiles in the FUSE data also indicate that the two heating mechanisms are correlated with very different non-thermal velocity fields. By extending the observations to younger Pleiades stars with similar B-V and v sini as some of the observed Hyades stars we hope to clarify the evolution of these heating processes and to determine whether other stellar parameters such as fossil magnetic fields) have an important effect in young main sequence stars.

These sudden drops in light are not accompanied by spectral changes i.e.  line blocking effects), which implies obscuration of the star by dusty concentrations.  Because SU Aur is viewed at high inclination (nearly edge-on), the source of these obscurations is most likely dust clumps around low mass companions (accreting protoplanets, protocomets, andor associated halos).  The accretion disk of SU Aur is therefore most likely in the process of forming embryonic planets.  FUSE  spectra will provide excellent data on the hot plasmas at various temperatures, compositions, dynamics, ionization states, and electron densities in the stellar chromosphere, transition region, and corona, along with the hot inner regions of the circumstellar disk.  The  FUSE observations will greatly improve our understanding of the complex inflow, accretion, and outflow dynamics that occur during this stage of evolution and possibly provide insights into the nature of the eclipse-like events.  The expected H_2 absorption lines will additionally provide important information on the cold gas and dust dynamics in the outer regions of the circumstellar disk.  We will also compare the spectra of SU Aur with that of the PMS star HD 283572 (previously observed by FUSE).  The two stars are excellent spectral-type matches, but HD 283572 lacks a circumstellar accretion disk.

The only remote means of detecting argon in comets is through observations of its fluorescence emissions at FUV wavelengths lambdalambda1048,1066), and fuse provides far greater sensitivity in this region than any other available facility. The CO abundance is highly variable among comets, and this is presumably related to the formation conditions of cometary nuclei and their subsequent thermal processing. fuse can measure CO emission in comets with exceptional sensitivity, reaching down to abundance  levels of sim0.1 on the elemental abundances of H, C, O, and N, and on the production of htwo and ion:  O  6 , the latter being produced by the same charge exchange mechanism that produces cometary x-ray emissions. Finally, nearly half of the more than 90 FUV cometary emissions detected during our previous fuse observations remain unidentified and are deserving of follow-up study in other comets.

These FUV spectra show evidence of a cool, high velocity wind of sim-100 kms^-1, indicating the primary of 22Vul is undergoing substantial outflow typical of other G-type supergiants. Surprisingly the spectra also show evidence for absorption in OVI, which suggests the presence of a hot wind or circumstellar envelope. Thus 22Vul may fall into the class of hybrid stars. In Cycle 5, 22 Vul has daily observability windows for pm3 weeks around the June 2004 eclipse, a situation unique for the foreseeable future.

The FUSE data were the cornerstone of this project (which included data from the VLA, MERLIN, ground-based optical spectroscopy and photometry, Chandra, and XMM).  Our Z And observations have motivated us to propose a new scenario which we term the disk-instability trigger.  To test this new model, we received FUSE cycle 4 time to continue the multi-wavelength campaign with FUSE observations at 6-8 epochs during the outburst of a second target-of-opportunity (TOO).  As our cycle 4 program has not yet been triggered, we propose here to continue this TOO observing opportunity into cycle 5.  Coordinated HST, XMM, and VLA observations for a second target have already been approved.  The evolution of the UV spectrum throughout the outburst plays a vital role in distinguishing between the outburst models currently in contention for describing outburst behavior.  Emission line strengths of the FUSE-band species, especially when combined with lines of the same species from the other spectral regions, provide diagnostics of the colliding windshock region.

Diffusion processes such as gravitational settling, radiative levitation, weak stellar winds, and accretion have been proposed to explain the abundance anomalies.  Our goal is to identify which mechanisms operate in the atmospheres of these stars, study their interactions, understand the abundance patterns, and ultimately, constrain the structure of the atmospheres of sdB stars.  However, only a handful of stars have been analyzed so far.  To remedy to this situation we are currently analyzing high resolution optical spectra of a large number of sdB stars that we obtained with the Multiple Mirror Telescope.  To complete this extensive abundance analysis we need FUSE observations, because many resonance lines of elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and many iron peak elements are only visible in the FUV range for the effective temperatures of interest.  This study will not only provide new insights to the stellar atmosphere structure of sdB stars, but also to the evolution of galaxies since these stars are the most important candidates for the source of the UV excess in elliptical galaxies and early-type spiral bulges.

Motivated by the upcoming exoplanetary search missions (such as Kepler, Eddington, SIM and DarwinTPF) that will search for earth-size planets in the habitable zones of nearby G--K stars, we are proposing to extend this program to cooler, less luminous, (but much more numerous) early K-type stars. This program parallels our Sun in Time program, but extends the study to stars with deeper convective zone depths. We wish explore the effect of the convective zone depth on magnetic activity by comparing dwarf G and K stars with similar rotation periods (and ages).

Our scientific objectives are twofold in observing BE UMa.  First, since this is an eclipsing system, the stellar and orbital parameters are relatively well determined, making BE UMa a good system to investigate the use of Lyman lines for estimating the temperature and gravity of the degenerate star.  Recent work with hot DA (pure-H) white dwarfs (Barstow et al. 2003) has demonstrated that at the highest temperatures, Lyman line temperatures and gravities diverge significantly from those obtained from the analysis of Balmer lines.  In addition, work in progress shows an even more profound divergence for the DAO (H-rich, with trace He) white dwarfs.  Second, FUSE spectra will provide a determination of the chemical content of the photosphere of the degenerate star.

FUSE is uniquely suited to determine whether an A star is still accreting, whether it exhibits signatures of stellar activity, and  whether it is driving a coronaldisk wind, since the FUV excess and emission line signatures at FUSE wavelengths have high contrast compared to the stellar photosphere. Recent FUSE observations of beta Pic and HD 100453 indicate that stellar activity persists into  the early phases of an A stars main sequence lifetime and is accompanied by the development of a coronal or disk wind as the star approaches the ZAMS. At present we do not know what the relation between the development of the coronaldisk wind and the jet outflow is, how this relates to the degree of central clearing of the disk, and whether there is any correlation with accretion rate.

Based on our theoretical models, we demonstrated that some He-sdB stars likely form from a delayed He-core flash on the white dwarf cooling curve (Lanz et al. 2003).  The convection zone produced by such a flash penetrates the hydrogen envelope, mixing hydrogen into the hot He-burning interior, and triple-alpha carbon outward into the envelope.  The resulting flash-mixed star shows greatly enhanced helium and carbon at its surface.  This phenomenon is analogous to the born again scenario for producing H-deficient R CrB stars following a very late He-shell flash.  The spectra of two of the three He-sdB stars in our previous FUSE program show a striking enhancement of carbon, just as expected for flash mixing.  In view of this success, we propose to follow our He-sdB work with observations of three high-gravity (logg> 6) He-rich sdO stars.  The location of these stars in the logg - log T_  eff  diagram is not populated by canonical evolutionary tracks for stars leaving the horizontal branch or asymptotic giant branch (AGB).

In these extremely metal-poor systems, the neutral ISM dominates the baryonic mass, and can hide the bulk of the metals produced by the galaxy during a lifetime. The relative abundances of metals which originate in different types of stars are also like a fossil record of the past star-formation (SF) history, the neutral gas tracing a more ancient past than the ionized gas in the HII regions due to larger timescales of the mixing processes that come into play.

However, only four suitable systems are know up to now. Recently we discovered a fifth one, HS2333+3927, consisting of an sdB star and an M dwarf (period 0.172d) with a very strong reflection effect, but no eclipses. Therefore additional information, such as a spectroscopic gravity measurement are required to derive an unambiguous solution. The reflection is stronger than in any of the other systems which renders a quantitative spectral analysis very difficult because the Balmer line profiles are disturbed by the reflected light. Mass-radius relations were derived from the results of the analysis of light and radial-velocity curves. Comparison with the observed mass-radius relation of the sdB star and with that of lower main sequence stars for the companion reveal a severe discrepancy. The spectroscopically estimated gravity (5.7 dex) of the sdB is too low by 0.1 to 0.15 dex to be consistent with the light and radial velocity curve. An improved spectroscopic measurement of the gravity is urgently needed. The Lyman series is ideally suited for this purpose, because it is not affected by light from the cool companion. The rotation of the sdB star is very likely tidally locked to the orbital motion. Determining the projected rotation velocity would therefore allow an independent estimate of the systems inclination. However, v,sin,i could not be derived from optical spectra. UV metal lines are much better suited. These measurements will allow to constrain mass and radius much better. Short period sdB binaries with dwarf companions, such as HS2333+3927, will evolve into cataclysmic variables, when the sdB has left the EHB. Therefore, these objects are crucial to understand pre-CV evolution. HS2333+3927 is the only sdB+dM system with a period larger than the CV period gap.

We showed by subsequent FUSE spectroscopy that the same phenomenon is exhibited by two related objects, a WC-PG1159 transition-type star and a so-called PG1159-hybrid star. Here we propose a systematic investigation of PG1159 stars to show if Fe-deficiency is a common phenomenon among these objects. We speculated that the iron underabundance is caused by the destruction of iron through s-process neutron capture as a consequence of a late helium-shell flash.

This curved motion is exciting because it is predicted by dynamical models of accretion disk winds. Our recent Cycle 5 FUSE observation supports this geometric model; both the radial velocities and equivalent widths of the absorption lines have decreased, suggesting that the absorber is leaving our line of sight to the BLR.

The two remaining positions (NGC4631-F and -H) are in the low halo of the galaxy above the disk. The OVI emission appears to be associated with the hot X-ray halo of NGC4631 and suggests that the gas is cooling galactic fountain gas. NGC4631 is the first, and only, galaxy in which a true galactic wide fountain has been detected. We request 5 additional measurements in the high halo of the galaxy to determine the full extent of the ovi emission and to estimate the cooling rate of the halo. With the data from these additional pointings, our fuse observations will cover nearly the full X-ray halo observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory (Wang 001). A comparison between this observed cooling rate for the halo gas with the mechanical input energy from supernovae will test the effectiveness of ovi emission as a cooling mechanism for fountain gas. These data may also be used to determine the scale height of the ovi gas at various locations in the disk. Subsequently, we will be able to compare the distribution and kinematics of this transition temperature gas with hotter gas Tsim1-3times10^6 K) as revealed by ROSAT and Chandra.'),('F088',6,'Stellar-Wind Variations in the Of?p Spectrum Alternator HD 191612','Walborn','','Space Telescope Science Institute','The Ofp star HD191612 was found in 2001 to display two peculiar, recurrent spectral states at optical wavelengths. In one the spectral type is near O6 and there are strong wind diagnostics, including a PCygni profile at Halpha; while in the other it is O8 with Halpha predominantly in absorption. Other peculiar spectral features alternate correlatively. This year, with the aid of Hipparcos photometry, the spectral variations have been found to be periodic and predictable. The optical behavior suggests that the UV wind features should vary drastically. We propose to investigate with FUSE, the only currently available UV spectrograph. There are favorable windows near three critical phases during 2005, including both extrema and a transition. Although by no means proven, the most promising current model for this bizarre behavior is tidally induced pulsations driving enhanced mass loss near periastron in an eccentric binary. The UV diagnostics should provide a valuable contribution toward a definitive model.

Subsequent work on giants of that type in the Magellanic Clouds has revealed a range of relative CNO and HeH line strengths, and three of them have been reclassified as ON2III. Available HST data show corresponding anomalies in the stellar winds. Modeling of these spectra shows that the phenomena correspond to abundance differences most likely caused by mixing of CNO-cycled material to the surfaces of evolving, very massive stars. We shall investigate the spectrum of one of the LMC nitrogen-rich objects, which is also helium-rich, at FUSE wavelengths, to search for and model additional relevant wind and photospheric diagnostics in the rich FUV spectral range. Two normal LMC O2 giants and an ON2 in the SMC have already been observed with FUSE and will serve as comparison objects; optical and HST data are also available for all four stars to support unified (windatmosphere) analysis. Another LMC ON2 has higher reddening, so that our target is the best case for FUSE investigation. These very hot N-rich objects may be evolving homogeneously and in any event will provide vital information about the evolution of the most massive stars, likely including the mixing effects of rotation according to current models.

FUV radiation is expected to significantly impact the photochemistry of the disk by photodissociating H_2 and CO and ionizing S, and will determine our ability to detect the gaseous component of the disk. Spitzer offers several emission lines to probe the gas at planet-forming radii of the disks. However, inferring a gas mass from these lines requires accurate measurements of the FUV field, which we can use to model the abundance structure and excitation of the gas. Therefore, we propose to use FUSE to measure the emission from 912--1185 AA for a sample of intermediate-aged solar analogues that have optically thin disks and span the range of timescales when residual gas may still be present. We will use this data, combined with disk models, to measure the gas content in disks from Spitzer spectra, ultimately leading to estimates of the evolution of gas mass with time in the planet forming regions of disks.

An archival Voyager UVS data set for this remnant shows CIII and OVI lines at levels readily detectable with the excellent diffuse source sensitivity of FUSE, but the Voyager spatial and spectral resolutions are far too low to provide the kinematical information we request here. Since the optical and X-ray emissions from the remnant are relatively faint, this supernova remnant appears to be dominated by FUV emission, making FUSE the ideal instrument to understand the global kinematic properties.

The O 6 1032AA emission line has been detected in FUSE spectra of the edge-on galaxy NGC4631, but not in the starburst galaxy M82 or in less-sensitive FUSE spectra of NGC891. Deeper spectra will answer the question of whether the NGC4631 halo is unique, or whether coronal gas is common in spiral galaxy halos. With these data we will) measure the mass circulation rate in the NGC891 halo, 2) compare the ionO6 cooling rate with that in the X-rays, and 3) begin to measure the distribution of coronal gas. Comparison of NGC891 with the previous NGC4631 detection will allow us to probe how these halo properties depend on star formation rate and galaxy mass, important steps toward quantifying models of the disk-halo interaction.

Centaurus A is the nearest active galaxy, and is close enough to permit detailed study of an AGN jet interacting with its host galaxy. Recent GALEX observations have detected Mid-UV (MUV, 200-1800AA) emission associated with the radio jet at distances up to 20 kpc from nucleus, particularly associated with the (optical) emission line filaments. Recent Chandra observations detect soft X-ray emission associated with one of the filaments. Taken together, these strongly suggest significant amounts of shock heating in at least one filament. However, the X-ray and optical data are not consistent with pure shock heating, and the X-ray detected filament is not directly impacted by the radio jet. Optical spectra are also not consistent with pure photoionization, e.g. beamed radiation from an obscured (to us) AGN. A FUSE detection, and measurement, of the O,VI flux associated with the optical, MUV, and X-ray observations, will allow us to determine the importance of shocks in ionizing this filament. Comparisons of FUSE observations with models will allow us to constrain the properties of whatever shocks are present.

We obtained excellent phase coverage of the May--June 2004 eclipse. It is clear from the variation of high excitation lines such as O VI that observations at other phases are needed to disentangle the relative contributions from various components of this system. For Cycle 6 we are proposing five observations of 22 Vul at critical positions in the orbit, particularly to sample the outer wind beyond the interorbit region.

The FUSE data were the cornerstone of this project (which included data from the VLA, MERLIN, ground-based optical spectroscopy and photometry, Chandra, and XMM). Our Z And observations have motivated us to propose a new scenario which we term the disk-instability trigger. To test this new model, we received FUSE cycle 5 time to continue the multi-wavelength campaign with FUSE observations at 6-8 epochs during the outburst of a second target-of-opportunity (TOO). As our cycle 5 program has not yet been triggered, we propose here to continue this TOO observing opportunity into cycle 6. Coordinated XMM, and VLA observations for a second target have already been approved. The evolution of the UV spectrum throughout the outburst plays a vital role in distinguishing between the outburst models currently in contention for describing outburst behavior. Emission line strengths of the FUSE-band species, especially when combined with lines of the same species from the other spectral regions, provide diagnostics of the colliding windshock region.

For hot sdB stars, calculations clearly indicate that the relative mode amplitudes as seen in the optical and in the Far UV strongly discriminates between values of the degree ell, allowing these to be easily determined. Such constraints on the mode identification are otherwise very difficult to obtain from optical multicolor photometry alone, as the discrimination between different ell values is weak when confined in this bandpass. The comparison of the FUV amplitudes of the modes detected by FUSE with their optical counterparts (from existing CFHT data and from planned contemporary observations at the Mt Bigelow 61 Telescope) will lead to an independent determination of the degree ell of the pulsation modes of PG 1219+534.

All close binaries evolve from the common envelope phase (CE) to shorter orbital periods due to orbital angular momentum loss. Despite its enormous importance for our understanding of close binary evolution, our current knowledge of the agent(s) responsible for extracting angular momentum from the system is very limited. One of the main reason for this discomforting situation is the scarcity of accurate systems parameters, which are necessary to calibrate and test theories of the CE phase and the subsequent loss of orbital angular momentum. The absence of mass transfer in PCEBs allows the determination of their binary parameters at a level unachievable in interacting close binary systems. Among the PCEBs, the detached white dwarfmain sequence binaries (WDMSs) offer the best environment in which to test any theory of close binary evolution, as they are numerous, bright, and their stellar components well-understood.

FUSE measurements of DO exhibit a trend of decreasing values with increasing distance beyond 100 pc. A consistent framework encompassing the behavior of DH and DO has proven elusive. Measurements of DH, DO, and other elemental abundances in different environments are essential for improving our understanding of chemical evolution within the Galaxy. It has been suggested that some of the seemingly contradictory abundance patterns may be the result of differential depletion of D and H onto dust grains. Unfortunately, relatively few lines of sight beyond the Local Bubble have a velocity structure that is simple enough for reliable measurements to be made, so the present sampling of different Galactic environments is insufficient to disentagle the possible contributing processes. Existing FUSE spectra for the three stars in this program (distances ranging from 400 to 1000 pc) reveal isolated DI lines. Preliminary analyses indicate that log N(DI) > 15, hence N(HI) should be high enough to be determined from the Ly,beta damping profile.

We request FUSE observations of 30 Dor to use emission lines to study both the physical conditions and kinematic properties of the hot gas in X-ray-bright shells. In particular, we will use the OVI emission lines, in conjunction with complementary X-ray and optical data, to study SNR shocks and interfaces between hot (>10^6 K) gas and the surrounding cooler (10^4 K) shell gas.

An important secondary goal is to determine mass-loss rates of the stellar winds of these evolved stars by observation of wind absorption features superimposed on the hot companions FUV continua. These supergiant binary systems are important, fundamental stellar laboratories useful in verifying and constraining models of stellar structure and evolution. We will proceed by measuring the hot stars radial velocity, preferably at more than one epoch (we will propose continuing observations for FUSE Cycles 7--8). The orbits of the cool supergiant primaries of the target binaries are being accurately determined from the PIs decade-long radial velocity program on the DAO 1.2m McKellar coude telescope. Then the companions velocity amplitude, K_2, can be found from a single radial velocity observation, although multiple observations are preferable. Nevertheless, a single observation will suffice to determine the mass ratio of the stars to 2--4 separated in orbital phase, the accuracy will be 1--2 Some target stars eclipse, and for these accurate stellar masses can be directly obtained. Masses of the remaining stars will be obtained from optical interferometry; these binaries are on the NPOI target list.

Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these variations, a global consistent picture of these abundance patterns is still missing. The low yield of high column density sightlines suitable for accurate DH measurements has been a major barrier to progress in this area. This derives from the extreme difficulty of finding suitable targets at these high N(H), both in terms of DI not being obscured by either HI or H_2 absorption and having data available to determine reliable N(HI) from Lyman alpha.  This proposal requests additional observing time to obtain signal-to-noise ratios adequate for determining the column densities of DI, NI, OI, and FeII, along three high N(H) sightlines that have been previously observed by FUSE. Preliminary analyses of the current datasets show that these sightlines are suitable for DI measurements and that they may have high DH ratios (> 1E-5).

This important and intriguing result is in the sense that the neutral gas phase abundances are significantly (approx 1 dex) lower than the HII region abundances.  Thus, the starburst environment may be surrounded by a lower metallicity halo.  This could be a result of either chemical pollution of the medium closely surrounding the starburst or a metallicity gradient from the inner (relatively) metal rich galaxy to an outer metal poor halo.  This potentially high impact result is not yet secure because the neutral gas absorption lines may yield underestimates of the abundances due to ionization, depletion, andor saturation effects affecting the various chemical elements.  For several reasons, oxygen is the ideal element to concentrate on, and by observing multiple OI lines with different oscillator strengths - and thereby addressing saturation concerns - we can obtain a secure absorption line oxygen abundance for the neutral gas phase for the first time.

Preliminary FUSE observations toward Fairall 9 have also been used to characterize the H_2 abundances in the Magellanic Stream, as well as detect the presence of collisionally ionized gas in the form of OVI.

We therefore request new FUSE observations to search for OVI emission from the interface layers of two superbubbles in the LMC, DEM L 152 and DEM L 92.  These FUV data will allow us to probe the 3E10^5K gas in the interface layer and, combined with previously obtained optical and X-ray data, to determine the physical parameters of the interface layer.'),('G058',7,'Understand Mass-loss in Cool Giants: the Wind of SY Mus','Espey','','Trinity College Belfast','For the majority of red giant stars the basic mass-loss processes at work are unknown. Indeed, for stars of spectral types between K0 III and M5-M6 III, much remains unknown about the regions above the visible photosphere and the transportation of the processed material outwards to the ISM. Theories and models are in need of observational constraint, and in particular it is vital to derive spatially resolved information throughout the wind acceleration region within a few giant radii of the stars photosphere. Eclipsing symbiotic binary systems, consisting of an evolved giant in orbit with a white dwarf, provide an opportunity to take advantage of the finite size of the hot component to probe different levels of the chromosphere and wind acceleration region in absorption. This provides spatially resolved thermal, ionisation and dynamic information on the wind which can then be compared against predictions of hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere codes. We propose 6 observations of the symbiotic SY Mus utilizing the 0 day periodicity inherent in FUSE scheduling to phase space the observations.  Results will be compared to PHOENIX hydrodynamical models and to similar observations of earlier spectral type symbiotic giants to constrain wind acceleration and chromospheric models.'),('G059',7,'The Enigmatic Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant N63A','Blair','','Johns Hopkins University','We propose follow-up FUSE observations of the supernova remnant N63A in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

The LWRS aperture position was dominated by a bright optical shocked cloud, and a strong signal was seen in OVI lambda lambda 032,1038, but not in CIII lambda 977, the other strong line normally seen in strong radiative shocks. In this proposal, we request two short observations at offset positions to diagnose the eastern bright X-ray shock and the SW limb that shows two protrusions in the Chandra X-ray image of Warren et al.

Two years ago the program was extended to include FUSE Cycle 5 observations of a sample of dK0-5 stars of different ages. Here we propose a 40 ksec FUSE observation of a carefully selected representative old disk dM star -- SZ UMa -- which will help complete the parameter space of age, rotation, and FUV emission for dM stars. Also, we wish to explore the effect of the CZ depth on magnetic activity by comparing dwarf G, K, and M stars with similar rotation periods and ages. Of particular interest is the determination of X-rayFUV emission flux evolution with age for dM stars. This is because of the critical roles that FUV TR and chromospheric emissions (dominated by HI Lyman series and CIII and OVI emissions) play on the photochemical and photoionization evolution (and possible erosion) of planetary atmospheres and ionospheres. This program will also have a major impact on studies of FUV radiation and its effects on the environments of extrasolar planets that may be hosted by dM stars and on the possible origin and evolution of extraterrestrial life on such planets. We plan to combine the FUSE FUV observations with X-ray and UV (from IUE or HST, where available) to form spectral irradiance tables (flux at 1 AU) of dM stars covering a wide range of ages.

It is a well known fact that the atmospheres of these extreme horizontal branch stars exhibit abundance anomalies.  Diffusion processes such as gravitational settling, radiative levitation, weak stellar winds, and accretion have been proposed to explain the abundance anomalies.  Our goal is to identify which mechanisms operate in the atmospheres of these stars, study their interactions, understand the abundance patterns, and ultimately, constrain the structure of the atmospheres of sdB stars.  With this proposal we want to complete our FUSE proposals E152 and F909 with targets that are feasible with the new FUSE.  Only four sdB stars out of forty have been already observed within these two programs, and only three more targets are still feasible.  This is why we propose observations of a new sample of sdB stars that can be done with the new FUSE.  To study and interpret the abundance patterns in sdB stars, we need a large sample of stars with atmospheric parameters that cover the whole effective temperature and gravity domains (20,000 K < T_eff < 40,000 K ; 5.0 < log g < 6.5).  To achieve a thorough abundance analysis we need FUSE observations, because many resonance lines of elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, iron peak elements, and elements beyond the iron group are only visible in the FUV range for the effective temperatures of interest.  This study will not only provide new insights into the stellar atmosphere structure of sdB stars, but also to the evolution of galaxies since these stars are the most important candidates for the source of the UV excess in elliptical galaxies and early-type spiral bulges.'),('G063',7,'The Effect of Metallicity of the Rotation Rates of Massive Stars','Penny','','College of Charleston','Recent theoretical predictions for low metallicity massive stars predict that these stars should have drastically reduced equatorial winds (mass loss) while on the main sequence, and as such should retain most of their angular momentum.  Observations of both the Be(B+Be) ratio and the blue-to-red supergiant ratio appear to have a metallicity dependence that may be caused by high rotational velocities.  But to date only two studies of the rotation rates of massive stars have been completed.  Their results differ, one finding that lower Z massive stars do rotate faster, one finding the opposite.  In addition both studies have limitations.  The first observed only stars with masses lower than 12 M_sun, which are not predicted by theory to have rotation rates affected by metallicity.  The second had only a small sample, and one which may have been skewed to narrow-lined targets.  The Multimission Archive at Space Telescope MAST) contains FUSE archival spectra of over 140 O-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds.  This is a significantly large sample that can be used to address this question with directly measured projected rotational velocities in a low metallicity environment.  The method to employ is that used in previous studies on both IUE and STISHST spectra (Penny 1996, Howarth et al. 1997, Penny et al. 2004).  An UV spectrum of a test star is cross-correlated with a narrow-lined star to create a cross-correlation function (CCF).  The width of this CCF is related to the intrinsic width of the spectral lines of the star.  To determine projected rotational velocities, an accurate calibration must be found between CCF widths and V sin i values, for a sample of stars for which these values are already known.  Archival FUSE spectra also exist for over 100 Galactic O-type stars with known projected rotational velocities.  However there is a paucity of narrow-lined targets from the Galaxy available.  This severely limits the calibration of CCF width to V sin i and results in overestimates of the latter from FUSE spectra.  The acquisition of five additional narrow-lined stellar spectra will complete the calibration of CCF width to V sin i.

The X-ray emission derives primarily from an embedded ultraluminous (approx 10^40 ergs s^-1) X-ray source (ULX).  The source is pointlike and may be an accreting intermediate mass (100-1000 M_odot) black hole.  Its relationship to the nebular shell is poorly understood. The shell may be a supershell blown by multiple stellar winds and SNe, or it may be the remnant of a single highly energetic (E > 10^53 ergs) explosion (i.e., hypernova). Understanding the kinematics of the shell will provide a critical clue to the origin of the X-ray source Ho IX X-1.  We will search for CIII andor OVI and other FUV line emission from the shell and use the line ratios to constrain the shock speed.  As a bonus, we also plan to search for emission from the compact photoionization nebula around the ULX itself.  The measurement of OVI from this source would provide valuable information such as the absorbing column in the immediate vicinity of the compact object and the shape of the ionizing spectrum.  The Ho IX X-1 shell is likely the only ULX with low enough extinction to be observable in the FUV, and is well-matched to the diffuse source capabilities of FUSE.'),('G073',7,'FUSE Observations of the UV-Bright Star in 47 Tucanae','Dixon','','Johns Hopkins University','We propose FUSE observations of the hot post-asymptotic giant branch PAGB) star BS in the globular cluster 47Tuc.

What is the source of this excess opacity  According to stellar evolution theory, stars that have undergone first dredge-up on the RGB should be enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon.  Its HUT spectrum suggests that the star is overabundant in nitrogen and underabundant in carbon, but the lines of both elements are are blended with interstellar features at the HUT resolution.

During the past two decades there has been a consensus that the rotation rates in Be stars are rapid but far short of their critical values (0.50 < VV_cr < 0.85). But recently there has been a renewed interest in the possibility that Be stars are critical rotators (Townsend, Owocki, & Howarth 2004).  Abundance studies can provide a test for the latter hypothesis, as stellar evolution modeling by Meynet & Maeder (2000) has predicted a significant enhancement in the photospheric N abundances in very rapidly rotating OB stars due to mixing of CNO-processed material from their interiors. The FUV is the best spectral region for determining CN abundances in Be stars as the strongest lines of CII, III and NII, III fall in this region and the flux contribution from the disk is not important. The Be star B12 in NGC330 is ideal for an abundance analysis as it has relatively sharp lines.  A recent abundance study from optical data (Lennon et al. 2005) suggested a low N abundance, but the result was inconclusive as it was based upon only one very weak line. The low N abundance in the SMC renders it an ideal environment in which to look for altered abundances due to rotational mixing.  We also propose an observation of a well-known, sharp-lined non-emission B star in NGC 330 (B30) in order to be able to compare the CN abundances in NGC330-B12 with benchmark values for the cluster.'),('G081',7,'Deep Quiescent Magnetic Activity State of alpha Cen A','DeWarf','','Villanova University','A long standing problem and a central topic of solar-stellar connection studies is that of relating the Suns magnetic behavior to other stars.  Our Sun is used as a fundamental calibration and as a reference point for stellar theory.  This requires that the Suns expressions of activity (distribution of magnetic active regions, coronal densities, emergence of magnetic flux, etc.) are fundamentally normal for a star of its age and evolutionary history.  Direct comparison with true solar analogs is critical for both understanding the magnetic nature of the Sun as well as magnetic phenomena in other stars.  alpha Cen is the nearest stellar system to our Sun.  The G2V primary (alpha Cen A) is an almost perfect solar analog with regard to its mass, radius, temperature, and convection zone depth, but is slightly older (tau approx 5-6 Gyr) than our Sun.  These properties are well determined through extensive studies, making it an ideal Sun-as-a-star comparison to test solar concepts.  Recently, X-ray emission fluxes for alpha Cen A were observed to diminish by a factor of nearly 25(), a phenomenon never before observed for the Sun of any solar-aged star.  The XMM observations imply that the chromospheric through coronal regions of alpha Cen A can be highly variable, with changes in both mean temperatures and, to a larger extent, the emission measures necessary to address these new observations.  The requested FUSE observations are crucial to a program to examine the long-term magnetic activity cycle of alpha Cen A.  We hope to observe alpha Cen A during Cycle 7 to obtain high quality FUV spectra during this unprecedented, very deep quiescent state of this up til now normal solar-type star.

Previous observations of white dwarfs in this temperature range have revealed surprisingly high metallicity in a subset of these stars.

The current wisdom about this phenomenon is that these stars are accreting matter, either interstellar or circumstellar, which then pollutes their atmospheres.

The capabilities of FUSE present us with an unparalleled opportunity to map a splash plasma in velocity and physical space, as many prominent shell-type absorption features are formed in this gas. Furthermore, the location, size, and temperature of the impact site can be well-determined because the flux contrast between the spot and the photosphere of the B7-8 mass gainer is large in the FUV.

Comparison of CO emissivity with infrared emission in a sample of dwarf galaxies suggests that the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor is more than 30times the assumed Galactic value. These observations suggest that a fraction of the dark matter associated with these galaxies is in the form of a large amount of hidden H_2. Up to this date, spheroidal dwarf galaxies have never been observed in the far ultraviolet (FUV) domain and no one has been able to put strong constraints on their H_2 content.

This program has a major impact on studies of FUV radiation and its effects on the environments of extrasolar planets that may be hosted by dM stars and on the possible origin and evolution of life on such planets. We will combine the FUSE FUV observations with existing X-ray (ROSATChandraXMM) and UV IUEHST) to form spectral irradiance tables (flux at 1 AU) of dM stars.

With Cycle 8 likely being the last proposal round for FUSE, we propose here for the remaining SMC supernova remnants as a STANDARD proposal, to ensure that a representative sample of SMC remnants is obtained for comparison with the LMC sample. As with our earlier requests, a standard 0 ks per object using the LWRS aperture will be used for these observations, reaching a limiting flux in OVI lambda1032 about a factor of 100 below the flux observed for the bright LMC remnant N49.

Other peculiar spectral features alternate correlatively. In 2004, with the aid of Hipparcos photometry, a 538d period was found in both light and spectral variations; while in 006, the detection of a magnetic field was announced, strongly suggesting an interpretation as an oblique rotator, only the second known with an O spectral type. The optical behavior suggests that the UV wind features should vary drastically, as they do in the other known O-type magnetic oblique rotator, theta^1OrionisC.

Although its distance (10^-5Mpc) might seem a bit close by normal extragalactic standards, in fact Arcturus belongs to an eponymous moving group thought to be a relic of a merger between a dwarf irregular galaxy and the Milky Way, some billions of years ago. Beyond its intriguing alien heritage, Arcturus has the dubious distinction of being the faintest---but positively detected---coronal X-ray source known, and one of very few red giants to Arcturus, and related Aldebaran (alphaTau; K5III), are centerpieces of a controversial idea to explain the ostensible lack of X-ray activity among red giants by the smothering of coronal loops in extended chromospheric envelopes. Arcturus was Science Team cool star targets. However, because of a variety of unfortunate circumstances, it was not successfully observed prior to the guidance system problems that subsequently have thwarted further attempts. mission nevertheless drawing to a close, it would be extremely valuable to secure an FUV spectrum of Arcturus; not only because its ionO6 lambda1031 and ionC3 lambda977 features can contribute in a unique way toward testing the buried corona hypothesis, but also to provide the sorely needed shortwavelength complement to the 1150--50,000AA spectral Atlases already available for the archetype red giant.

The scale heights, line velocities, and time variability suggest confinement in large-scale magnetic loops reaching up to heights of at least K star radii. These lines probe the emission measures and temperatures along this line of sight. HST spectra show that the atmosphere is asymmetric, clumpy, hot, and time-variable.

As a consequence, emission lines of CIII and OVI, which are linked to the activity of the star, are highly expected in the FUSE spectrum. The analysis of H_2 circumstellar lines in the FUSE spectrum will allow us to quantify the gaseous content in the inner planet-forming regions of the disk around the star, and determine the possible correlation between the stellar activity and the excitation of the gas.

We propose to extend this study beyond the Milky Way with FUSE observations of star-forming regions in the Magellanic Clouds. N66 is the most massive star-formation site in the SMC, with extensive regions of gas and dust excited by far-ultraviolet photons from cluster O-stars. N11B is a region of massive star formation in the LMC, with several stars of spectral type B1 and earlier illuminating bright nebular filaments, suggesting that is an external analog to the Orion Nebula. The unique bandpass and spectral resolution of FUSE will enable an unprecedented study of extragalactic dust and may provide the first detection of far-ultraviolet H_2 emission outside the Milky Way. Combining observations of dust-scattered light from these clusters with stellar observations in the FUSE archive, we can constrain the ultraviolet grain properties of the Magellanic Cloud dust.

For these nineteen objects we will be able to detect or limit the escape fraction of lyman continuum photons from star forming galaxies at the 5 detection threshold. By characterizing f_esc at low redshift across a wide spectrum of galaxy types, we obtain data that can be used to constrain the fraction of ionizing radiation originating in starburst galaxies during, and after, the era of reionization of the universe.

Since the residence times of many elements against gravitationallly driven downward diffusion are rather short, any abundance enhancements would be expected to decay between events on timescales of days, weeks or months. Therefore, we might expect to see variations in measured abundances or even disappearance of certain elements on these timescales.

These abundance measurements are based on FUSEHSTIUE spectra which covered the ionFe3 to Fe 6 absorption lines, enabling a detailed iron abundance analysis over a wider range of effective temperatures than previously afforded. The observed iron abudance variations may be imputed to accretion from unseen companions or so-called circumstellar debris although the effect of residual mass-loss and selective radiation pressure in the hottest objects in the sample may remain dominant.

Short-term variations have been extensively studied, with maps of surface structure (Doppler Images) obtained at many epochs. Year-to-year variations in these maps suggest that the active regions evolve on intermediate timescales. Because of observational constraints from the ground and previous spacecraft, these intermediate time domains have been very poorly studied. The unique capabilities of the FUSE spacecraft provide us an unprecedented opportunity to study stellar activity over these scientifically critical, intermediate timescales. We will observe ABDor for 90 ksec (2 rotational period) during each of its CVZ windows during Cycle 8. This will provide full sampling of timescales between 2 and 16 months, the equivalent of observing solar activity on timescales from 8 to 67 years.

Despite its enormous importance for our understanding of close binary evolution, our current knowledge of the agent(s) responsible for extracting angular momentum from the system is very limited. One of the main reason for this discomforting situation is the scarcity of accurate systems parameters, which are necessary to calibrate and test theories of the common envelope phase and the subsequent loss of orbital angular momentum. The absence of mass transfer in PCEBs allows the determination of their binary parameters at a level unachievable in interacting close binary systems. Among the PCEBs, the detached white dwarfmain sequence binaries (WDMSs) offer the best environment in which to test any theory of close binary evolution, as they are numerous, bright, and their stellar components well-understood.

O VI 1032-1038 emission is expected to track the coronal lines. O VI is also expected to be the primary cooling transition for the million-degree shocked gas. A measure of the O VI line strength will significantly improve current models of the shock interaction.

As such they may be in states of mass loss prior to, or in lieu of, the development of a cool wind. ii) Their chromospheric ion: Mg 2 emission profiles often show no evidence of outflow, thus if winds are present they must accelerate with altitude. iii) They may be relevant to the mechanism by which Population II red giants, which have --2.7 < Mv < --1.7 and similar effective temperatures, lose mass prior to becoming horizontal branch stars. High-altitude TR emission lines are well suited to test for accelerating winds.

Not only is this line strong, is nearly black, which occurs only if the hot gas is optically thick and on the near side of the bulge. This absorbing gas, near 3E5 K, is either due to a bulge cooling flow or a galactic fountain-driven halo.

The ionO6 line, observable by FUSE in low redshift BLRGs, offers an important probe of the high-ionization line emission. The profile yields information about the kinematics of the line emitting region; the ratio of the ionO6 line with other high-ionization lines yields information about the ionization state and abundances in the emitting gas. Yet, despite the great promise that FUSE observations of BLRGs harbor, only one has been observed so far. We propose observations of three of the brightest double-peaked BLRGs that also have supporting UV spectra. Included in our sample is the prototype double-peaked BLRG 3C390.3. It harbors a massive black hole (M_BH,,2.9times,10^8M_sun) and exhibits a low accretion rate (.M.M_Edd,,0.02). Thus, 3C390.3 presents a test of the extreme end of Eigenvector 1, which is believed to be related to the fraction of the Eddington luminosity at which the object is emitted.'),('H096',8,'FUV Activity Cycles in the alpha Cen proposal site.','DeWarf','','University of Villanova','Since 1990 we have been engaged in the Sun in Time project -- a program of coordinated multiwavelength observations of solar-type stars. These stars have been selected as proxies for the Sun at stages throughout its main-sequence lifetime, and are single, main-sequence G0-G5 stars of ages from sim70 Myr (representing the ZAMS Sun), to stars of approximately solar age, like alpha Cen A, together with older solar analogs with ages up to sim8.5 Gyr. These stars all have similar physical properties mass, radius, temperature, and depth of convection zone), differing only in age, or equivalently, rotation period. Specifically, we use these stars to investigate the decline in the level of solar magnetic activity as the Sun spins down, and also changes in the activity cycle with age. An important component of this Sun in Time project is the investigation of magnetic activity cycles that occur within these solar proxies, and the changes in the high energy coronal and transition region emissions. Recently, X-ray emission fluxes for one of our program stars, alpha Cen A, was observed to diminish by a factor of sim25 in only two years time, a phenomenon never before observed for any solar-aged star. The XMM observations imply that the chromospheric through coronal regions of alpha Cen A can be highly variable, with changes in both mean temperatures and the emission measures necessary to address these recent observations. We propose here to observe alpha Cen three times during Cycle 8 to delineate the evolution of this unprecedented, very deep magnetic inactivity state of this solar-type star. These new observations will be compared to the previously existing Cycle 2 spectra secured before this dramatic magnetic drop began, and the recent Cycle 7 observations obtained shortly after its X-ray minimum. We find that in this short span of five years alpha Cen A has exhibited a significant drop of approximately 2.5-3times in the key FUV emissions, which may indicate an activity cycle.'),('H098',8,'Further Eclipse Mapping of Symbiotic Binaries','Crowley','','Trinity College Dublin','For the majority of red giant stars the basic mass-loss processes at work are unknown. Indeed, for stars of spectral types between K0 III and M5-M6 III, much remains unknown about the regions above the visible photosphere and the transportation of the processed material outwards to the ISM. Theories and models are in need of observational constraint, and in particular it is vital to resolved information throughout the wind acceleration region within a few giant radii of the stars photosphere. Eclipsing symbiotic binary systems, consisting of an evolved giant in orbit with a white dwarf, provide an opportunity to take advantage of the finite size of the hot component to probe different levels of the chromosphere and wind acceleration region in absorption. This provides spatially resolved thermal, ionization and dynamic information on the wind which can then be compared against predictions of hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere codes. We propose FUSE observations of 2 eclipsing symbiotic systems, utilizing the 60 day periodicity inherent in FUSE scheduling to phase space the observations. Results will be compared to PHOENIX wind models and also to a successful analysis of other eclipsing systems (EG And and BF Cyg with FUSE) with different binary and giant parameters, with a view towards constraining the wind acceleration and chromospheric models.'),('H099',8,'The Abundances of the Iron Group Elements in Early B Stars in the Magellanic Inter-Cloud Region','Peters','','University of Southern California','We propose FUSE observations of two sharp-lined main-sequence band early B stars that reside in the bridge region between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, to determine the abundances of the Fe group elements in these objects.

To compare the abundances in the LMC and SMC with those in their bridge, we are proposing FUSE observations of two early B bridge stars (DI1162 and DI1239) that have been found suitable for abundance analyses. Ground-based spectroscopic studies of these and two other objects have suggested extreme metal deficiencies in the Inter-Cloudbridge that are lower than those that prevail in both Magellanic Clouds and more than 1.0 dex smaller than in our galaxy. Unlike the optical region that is devoid of measurable lines from most Fe group ions, the FUSE spectral region contains numerous ionV3, ionCr3, ionMn3, and ionFe3 features.

The flux from the secondary will significantly dominate in the FUV, so we propose FUSE observations of this object to determine the nature of this puzzling object.

The FUV spectrum, which is dominated by the white dwarf (WD), has only sporadically been observed and only at quiescent phases, yet shows variability in the strengths and profiles of both the slow K-star wind and fast WD-outflow emission lines. The orbital modulation of the FUV spectrum has never been investigated nor has the WD wind been systematically monitored. Such monitoring is particularly important for providing information about the collision zone between the two winds and the accretion rate of material onto the WD that powers the luminosity and outbursts. The proposed FUSE observations will be part of a multiwavelength campaign to observe an anticipated major eruptive event for AG Dra that occurs approximately every 14 years. The next major eruption is likely to occur during 20072008, during the upcoming FUSE cycle; such an event for AG Dra has never been recorded at FUV wavelengths, where the bulk of the emission is expected to occur. In the event of a strong outburst we also propose a target of opportunity observation, to be made within the first month following maximum brightness. FUSE will be the only source for UV spectroscopy during this event, it is important to be able to correlate flux variations with those recorded at optical and infrared wavelengths, as for example the O VI lambda1032 line flux with known Raman scattering feature at lambda6825.

However, the vast majority of non-radiative, collisionless astrophysical shocks propagate into fully ionized gas. We cannot extend our model to these cases unless we know what role, if any, is played by the presence of partially neutral gas in equilibration at the shock fronts of Balmer-dominated SNRs. To clarify this issue, we propose FUSE observations of the Magellanic Cloud supernova remnants SNR 0534-69.9, SNR 0103-72.6 and SNR 0049-73.6, three remnants exhibiting non-radiative shocks in fully ionized gas. Combined with the Chandra observations, the OVI emission line widths and fluxes from these SNRs will enable us to make the most direct measurement of temperature equilibration in fully pre-ionized shocks.

FUSE spectra, with corollary data at longer wavelengths, will uniquely enable precise determination of stellar parameters, especially Teff, mass loss (when present), and some abundances. FUSE spectra will also reveal possible circumstellar molecular hydrogen, yielding additional clues to the previous (red-giant) phases. Observations of binary systems will shed new light on evolutionary sequences predicted theoretically but which have previously been difficult to explore. The results are relevant in the context of stellar evolution but also of galaxy evolution, since these objects play a major role in the chemical enrichment of the ISM and their parent galaxy. The sample also includes sdB stars, which are thought to be the cause of the UV upturn in elliptical galaxies. The GALEX UV Sky Surveys provided the first unbiased and possibly complete census of such objects in the Milky Way (Bianchi et al. 2006a), that are elusive in optical surveys because of their high temperatures (to which optical colors are insensitive) and low optical luminosities.

Information about the ionization balance, velocity law, and mass-loss rates associated with these winds can be derived from modeling.

Through P117 and other PI-team programs, this spectral domain is well covered for Galactic OB and WR stars. However, the existing coverage of parameter space for the LMC and SMC is biased toward supergiants and hotter stars. With this proposal, we seek to mitigate these biases by supplementing the original sample of PI and GI targets in the LMC and SMC with objects of lower luminosity.  This additional coverage of the H-R diagram will enable us to determine where the stellar wind  turns off,  and the dependence of this point on metallicity.

However, there remains a strong desire to observe both targets at the higher spectral resolution afforded by the MDRS aperture.  For example, one of the initial objectives for the Io torus was to determine the velocity distribution (expected to be non-Maxwellian) of the principal sulfur ions, S II, S III  and S IV.  Higher resolution would also make the analysis of the multitudinous lines of H_2 seen in the auroral spectrum much more tractable.

From Deboer et al (1981) to Keenan et al(1985), the determination of this ratio proved to be difficult and nothing could been said about possible variations because of the scatter of data and the error bars. Then, using GHRS data, Meyer at al (1998) tried to set a  Definitive Oxygen Abundance  and found 50 % depletion in the LISM (gaz phase). Still, the survey implied only 13 targets so that nothing can be said as to variation or gradient. In particular, distant targets are required to test the metal poor infall scenario (to explain the LISM depletion) but such targets show strong H2. The next step would be to improve the statistic but to do so means to be able to choose a large sample of targets for which a non negligible fraction of H may be in H2 molecules. The most useful sample of targets comes from the Lauroesch survey (STIS 1998) where lines of sight were selected to show 1356 A OI transition. From this survey, I extracted 19 very nice lines of sight, showing clear velocity structure and no blending. Actually, 14 of them are planned FUSE target or already in the FUSE archive.

In the oblique  rotator model, proposed by Stibbs (1950), chemical elements are not  homogeneusly distribuited on the stellar surface, and the observed variations  are due to the stellar rotation. The anomalous abundances are caused by diffusion process (Michaud, 1970). Magnetic fields are suspected to influence the diffusion by suppressing mass-motions and changing the path of ionised species (Michaud et al., 1981),  so that diffusion in CP stars results in a non-homogeneous distribution of  elements over the stellar surface. The vertical stratification of chemical elements in the atmospheres of CP stars was predicted from results of radiative diffusion processes. In order to study  this phenomenon, one attempt we can make is to compute chemical abundances by  measuring different lines of the same element, formed at different layers of  the atmosphere. FUSE offers the possibility to look very deep in the atmosphere of these stars,  so it is possible to select a number of spectral lines, that together with other lines observed in optical spectra, will furnish an unique opportunity to  improve our knowledge about vertical stratification.'),('P234',2,'Extended Grid in the Northeast Cygnus Loop','Sankrit','Ravi','Johns Hopkins University','We will obtain MDRS spectra at two locations near a Balmer filament in the northeast region of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant.

The OVI flux was found to decrease as a function of position downstream behind the shock front.  Weak emission on the wings of the primary OVI 1032 component was detected at all three locations.  The flux in these weaker components was about the same in all three spectra.  The current observations are designed to measure the OVI flux in regions away from the filament.  This will allow us to examine the OVI emission that may be present, arising from regions other than the shocked gas in the Balmer filament.  We expect he same strength in each of the spectra. The current observations are designed to measure the OVI flux in regions away from the filament.  From these measurements we will be able to estimate the contribution of sources other than the primary shock to the total OVI flux in the remnant.

Former studies indicated that some (DIBs) are weaker in reflection nebulae than in diffuse clouds of  equivalent reddening. Few attempts were made to explain the DIBs peculiar behavior toward those particular environments.

In addition, the  extinction curves of HD190603 and HD198478 only differ in the FUV non-linear  rise portion.

The proposed targets are two young hot stars, DI1388 and DGIK975, and not only search for molecular hydrogen will be made possible, but a detailed investigation of the physical conditions within the MB gas will be studied in different spatial positon (DGIK975 is near the LMC while DI1388 is near the SMC).

This star is surrounded by a HeII nebula (Garnett et al. 1991), one of only six known in the Local Group. The presence of HeII emission requires that the ionizing star emit photons with energy greater than 54 eV, which in turn requires a stellar effective temperature of 70,000 - 80,000 K. Wolf-Rayet stars have temperatures in the 30,000 - 60,000 K range (Conti 2000), and in fact no population I stars are known to have temperatures as high as those required by the HeII emission. Either AV336a is a very rare type of star, or else the ionization source in this HII region is not understood.  The FUSE bandpass provides a unique opportunity to study both AV336a and the surrounding HeII nebula. The stellar spectrum will provide information on the stellar winds and abundances, which will shed light on the unusual nature of this star. Secondly, the absorption spectrum of the intervening material in the HeII nebula will provide information about other highly ionized elements. The adjacent ionization stages of PIII, IV, and V and S III, IV, and VI in the FUSE bandpass, as well as other ionized gas diagnostic lines, will be used to measure the luminosity of the star at energies well above the Lyman limit, providing a strict diagnostic of the stellar temperature.

By categorising in detail the nature of the corona of 44i Boo, one may shed light on how the magnetic dynamo operates in stars.

With FUSE, we can use denser molecular clouds within which one might expect H and D to be in their molecular form. In such cases, molecular fractionation correction is not required and direct measurement of D/H could result from HD/H2 ratios.  Until recently, HD/H2 measurements were limited to these  few good candidates where the velocity structure could allow for an isolated translucent intervening cloud, but saturation and low S/N of these detections implied large uncertainties on the result.

The emission from the highly-ionized species was  unexpected, as standard stellar theory predicts that these stars (with spectral  types earlier than about F0) should not have convective outer layers, and  therefore, should not have chromospheres, coronae, or strong stellar winds.While these stars clearly do show stellar activity, the exact nature is unclear.  AB Aurigae shows strong stellar winds and it is thought that the highly-ionized species may be formed by shocks in the wind.  Beta Pic, on the other hand, shows emission from OVI and CIII, but no trace of stellar winds.  Since Beta Pic is older than AB Aur, this difference  might indicate that the stellar activity is changing (possibly decreasing) with age.  To demonstrate this, we need to study young stars with a variety  of ages.  Unfortunately, most of the targets in P119 and Q119 are younger  than about 10 Myr; Beta Pic is the only one that is clearly older  (age ~ 20-30 Myr).

In current nomenclature, we distinguish 8 types of neutron  star QPOs (from kHz to Hz and below). As to the black hole QPOs, a few cases  have been observed in the same frequency range and show many similarities with  neutron star QPOs. Nevertheless, at present the BH QPO studies are based on very  few objects (Dimitrios 1999). Many theoretical models have been proposed for the  different QPOs. Some of them identify the frequency with Keplerian orbital  motion others suggest a hydrodynamic pulsation in the disk, others again imply  general relativistic effects. But some of these models only apply to neutron  star QPOs (hard surface, magnetic field) and some others only to BH QPOs.  Opening the FUV window, FUSE will allow for the study of highly ionised species  in the accretion disk. In particular, the O VI doublet ratio will help to put  a limit on the density of these disk and the broadening of these lines should  also put a constraint on the Keplerian model.

'),('X006',0,'Jupiter system ERO','Feldman','Dr. Paul D.','The Johns Hopkins University','This program consists of separate observations of two components of the Jovian magnetospheric system, the Jovian north polar aurora and the Io plasma torus. For the aurora, the goal is to observe the H2 bands at high spectral resolution to determine both the rotational and kinetic temperatures of H2 and the absorption below 1108 A. From this self-absorption, we can derive the H2 column densities above the level of deposition of the energy of the precipitating particles so as to determine also the penetration depth of these particles and thus their energy. The analysis of the H2 Rydberg lines (below 1200 A) and the H Lyman series would refine the auroral diagnostic regarding the identity (still unknown) and the penetration level of the magnetospheric particles that precipitate into the upper atmosphere. Correlated observations with HST/STIS will provide complete spectral coverage of the H2 Lyman and Werner bands systems from 900 to 1650 A. Our second objective is to search for minor constituents in the Io torus plasma which consists primarily of sulfur and oxygen with a sprinkling of sodium. There is good reason to expect that other species may be present, for instance carbon may be produced by sputtering off the other moons. Argon may be present due to the radioactive decay of potassium in the body of the moons. These and other elements have strong lines in the FUSE range. FUSE observations of the torus will provide a sensitivity which is a thousandfold below the strong lines of the dominant species, ionic sulfur and oxygen. The large FUSE aperture provides an ideal capability for this study because of the large angular extent of the LWRS aperture and the high dispersion which separates the lines from other contaminating features.

Together with mass loss from red giant stars, they represent the process by which intermediate mass stars eject appreciable amounts of processed, chemically enriched material. The deep convective envelopes of these stars (PN progenitors) should cycle material to a temperature regime where deuterium should be easily destroyed (yielding 3He). Thus an important test of this process is to attempt to detect deuterium in the neutral envelopes of planetary nebulae. The second objective of this program will be to detect the presence of H2 in a planetary nebula. It is not known if any H2 present in the atmosphere of the PN progenitor survives the ejection process. H2 might form either in the cool stellar wind of the progenitor or in the cool, neutral envelope of the PN itself. These two objectives can be met with FUSE spectra of the central stars of selected PN. These stars are extremely hot and provide a good FUV spectrum for absorption spectroscopy of the neutral envelope. The central stars are also very interesting in their own right, being the hot evolved cores of intermediate mass stars.

Using the HST modeling, we can deconvolve the components into natural groups for which average group abundances are available from the HST data. Four preliminary investigations will be made: 1) an augmentation of the abundance studies done previously, in particular the addition of the elements N, O, Ar, P and Al; 2) determination of the gas temperature and of the radiation temperature of molecular hydrogen; 3) determination of the presence of O VI, N II, N III, S III, S IV, P III, P V, and Fe III; and 4) exploration of the excitation and ionization level of the H II regions in the gas of the SMC. A companion proposal for an ERO on an LMC star, HD36402, is being submitted in parallel with this proposal.

However, of the known 300+ WR stars in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds, only five are of WO-type, characterised by extremely broad high excitation oxygen and carbon emission lines in their UV and optical spectra, with mammoth OVI 3811-34A emission, reaching 10 times the local continuum.

This will allow a complete mass-loss model that incorporates the ionization balance and abundances of the elements that drive the winds. The data will enable a direct comparison of these effects in local galaxies with modest (LMC) and substantially (SMC) lower abundances than our Galaxy. In addition, higher ionization states like O VI will be observed with high spectral resolution for the first time. However, the main science driver is the wealth of new lines available for study, which will enable significant new wind models to be developed in a short time. Differential comparison between the SMC/LMC stars, and with similar targets in the Galaxy (probable SV or ERO targets too), will provide added interest with cosmological significance. These observations will illustrate the power of FUSE for hot star studies by providing an initial comparison of spectra for objects in different galactic environments. The same targets will also be of interest for ISM studies, although the proposed exposures will not produce optimum S/N for the resolution required for narrow interstellar lines. The spectra will also enable the UV extinction curves below Ly alpha to be compared between galaxies. The UV extinction is known to differ significantly at IUE and HST wavelengths, presumably due to the different composition and grain size in the different ISM.

In recent months, there have been changes of a factor 2 or more in the central star, and this is leading to changes in the nebular spectrum and ionisation. The FUSE range opens up a major new set of lines of diagnostic interest. As the UV flux arises in the ~15\" nebula as well as the central star, it would add to the science to observe it through more than one FUSE aperture. HD5980 is a hot variable star in the SMC.

Stars slightly hotter than Altair do not show these phenomena, apparently due to shallower convective zones. FUSE can obtain a rich FUV emission line spectrum that will likely contain C III, O VI, and the hydrogen Lyman emission lines. A FUSE spectrum of Altair will enable us to determine whether or not the relative heating rates for the 10^4, 10^5, and >10^6 K plasma follow the trends seen in the cooler stars, whether the heating is acoustic or magnetic in character, and whether the emission line shapes and Doppler shifts indicate a wind or interesting dynamics.

FUSE observations at this relatively early epoch are fundamental for understanding the energetics and dynamics of a nova outburst, when a substantial portion of the flux is emerging in the FUSE window, but in the case of this particular nova the need is more acute. The fact that this object is so close in morphology, dynamics, and line strength to a galactic nova (and one for which we have FUSE spectra) means we will be able to complete the determination of the bolometric luminosity of both novae and with these and V1974 Cyg, likely the calibration of this entire subclass of novae. There are already striking similarities between the V382 Vel development and V1974 Cyg. In fact, we used the latter to predict observations of the more recent outburst.

We have recently developped the case for the presence of large masses of cold molecular hydrogen in the outer disks of spiral galaxies and in dwarf irregulars.  The bulk of the H$_2$ gas would be located in small clumpuscules, the smallest fragments of the hierarchical fractal structure of the gaseous interstellar medium.  Because they are cold, only absorption in front of external sources can reveal them.  Since we want to sample the outer disk, suitable sources are not stars, but remote QSO\'s almost in the plane of the disk ($b < 10^circ$).  In regions with no or very little dust, it is possible to probe larger column densities than for normal clouds, up to the limit where the H$_2$ itself absorbs most of the UV-light of the QSO.  In the solar neighbourhood, we can also probe high-latitude molecular clouds, in front of high-latitude QSO\'s.

The heating mechanisms may depend on T$_{eff}$, gravity, rotation, magnetic fields, age, chemical composition, and, possibly, binarity.  In order to identify the heating mechanisms, we need to disentangle the dependences on all these parameters.  We propose to do this by observing the 1032 & 1038~AA O~VI emission lines in a large sample of main sequence Hyades F stars.  These stars are chosen since they are the brightest cluster stars with strong TR-emission and because marked changes in the heating mechanisms apparently occur around spectral type F5, leading to easily-observable effects on our spectral diagnostics.  In addition, the age, chemical composition, and surface gravity of these stars are essentially the same, removing dependences on 3 of the stellar parameters.  Relations between the lower-TR and upper-TR emissions, together with their relationships to the coronal X-ray emission will tell us the relationship between heating mechanisms in the different layers.  We already have reliable lower-TR emission line (e.g.  C~IV) measurements for 15 Hyades F stars observed by IUE and will be obtaining such for 17 additional Hyades F stars in an approved Cycle 7 HST program.

In order to contrast the properties of local galaxies with those of the high redshift galaxies associated with DLAs it is important to compare environments of similar metallicity.  The Magellanic Clouds (MCs), with their low metallicity, are ideally suited for this purpose. FUSE and ORFEUS have already allowed the measurement of H_2 along several MCs sightlines. Unfortunately, the CrZn ratio has been determined only for three MCs sightlines Roth & Blades, 1997), for none of which H_: 2 has been searched for.

Unlike massive binaries, the winds of a symbiotic system have very different characteristics -- the hot wind is very thin and fast, whereas the cool wind is slow and weakly ionized -- and hence they can be isolated spectroscopically.  In addition, the white dwarf secondary of the symbiotic systems provides a far-UV continuum source against which absorption from a broad range of ionization levels can be seen, ranging from molecular hydrogen surrounding the giant star to highly ionized material in the wind collision region.

Our main scientific objective is therefore to measure FUV variations in the stellar flux of HD 179949 sampling different planet orbital phases (eg, phiapprx 0--0.5) to detect the stellar effect at the relevant geometries of the interaction.

To explain the abundance patterns of both dominant and trace elements, several processes must be called upon, namely upward diffusion of hydrogen left over from previous evolutionary phases, downward settling of heavy elements, convective dredge-up from deeper layers, convective mixing, accretion from the ISM, radiative element support, stellar winds etc. Our picture of the abundance patterns of trace elements remains sketchy, however, especially for the cooler DB stars. We propose to secure spectra for three DB stars spanning the effective temperature range between 14,400 and 17,900 K with the specific aims of obtaining abundances of several elements (principally C, but also Si, N, Fe) and of testing the reliability of our model atmospheres in that wavelength range. The FUSE observations will provide us with a unique opportunity to study the competing physical processes which affect the photospheric abundance of heavy elements in DB stars.'),('H003',8,'Evolution of the Intrinsic Absorption in AGN proposal site.','Crenshaw','','Georgia State University','We propose to follow the long-term evolution of mass outflows from AGN FUSE observations of Seyfert galaxies that have previously-detected blueshifted absorption lines. The new observations, combined with our archive program on intrinsic absorption in AGN, will allow us to track the absorption variability over a range of time scales up to sim9 years, and thereby place tight constraints on the changing physical conditions (ionization parameters, column densities), kinematics (transverse velocities, radial velocities), and geometry covering factors) of the outflowing absorbers. We will then use these constraints to identify the dynamical forces (radiation pressure, magnetocentrifugal acceleration, andor thermal expansion) responsible for driving the gas outward and thereby investigate the nature and origin of the mass outflows.'),('H064',8,'The North Ecliptic Pole Supercluster A Window into the Missing Baryons','Dupke','','University of Michigan','Simulations predict that nearly half of the baryons in the local universe a re in a moderately hot phase, 1E5--1E7 K, largely in the form of giant cosmic filaments that connect the denser virialized clusters of galaxies. Since they are tenuous and have low overdensities these missing baryons evade detectability and are missing from census of the baryonic content of the local universe. They, however, can be detected through absorption lines they produce in the spectra of background AGNs. The highest covering fraction of such filaments occurs in superclusters and an initial study of AGNs projected behind superclusters has shown absorption systems ( in LyalphaLybetaOVI) at the supercluster redshifts. Here we propose to build upon our initial successful detections and expand our sample by nearly 40 in the ROSAT North Ecliptic Pole survey. This is best known supercluster to study the Cosmic Web because it is entirely selected in X-rays, which defines the real potential well best, but also has the largest number of bright background AGNs among all cataloged superclusters. Furthermore, it matches very well the current observational constraints of FUSE, which is, with the demise of STIS, the only satellite capable of detecting the key absorption lines for this study.'),('H094',8,'Elemental Abundances for the Iron Group in Early B Stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud','Peters','','University of Southern California','From FUSE data obtained in earlier cycles, we are mapping the abundances of the Fe group elements in the Magellanic Clouds directly from the analyses of photospheric spectra of early B stars using the technique of spectrum synthesis. But currently we have spectra of only three B stars in two OB associations (NGC1818-D1, NCG2004-B15, and NGC2004-B30). To supplement these data, we propose FUSE observations of two additional sharp-lined main-sequence early B stars (LH10-3270 and LH104-39) that reside in other LMC regions. Both objects have significantly younger ages than the LMC stars that we have already studied and are sufficiently isolated and bright enough for FUSE observations with the LWRS aperture. The FUSE spectral region contains numerous lines of ionV3, ionCr3, ionMn3, and ionFe3, but the optical region is almost devoid of measurable features of these species. The abundances will be compared with those obtained from the interstellar gas and A supergiants. The FUSE observations will allow us to assess the chemical evolution of the LMC and the past history of Types Ia and II supernovae across this galaxy.'),('H907',8,'An Extended Survey of Stellar Magnetic Activity on Young Stars','Brown','','University of Colorado','Young stars have very high levels of stellar activity (e.g. UV and X-ray emission) that can strongly influence the formation and evolution of their protoplanetary systems. The high energy emission, both as radiation and particles, resulting from magnetic activity on the central star controls the thermal structure of disks, the formation process of planetesimals, and the photoexcitation and photoionization of protoplanets and young planetary atmospheres. The dwarfs of the Local Association, whose ages range from 7 Myr to 200 Myr, are a remarkable sample of young stars very close (typically nearer than 0 pc) to the Sun that permit the detailed study of the evolution of stellar activity. We propose a Cycle 8 Survey project to enlarge the sample of older Local Association dwarfs with measured transition region (100,000 K) emission line fluxes.'),('P107',1,'Deuterium Abundances and the D/H Ratio (Snapshot Survey)','Sembach','K.','','This portion of the D/H program will provide short observations of many  AGNs and QSOs to check far ultraviolet flux levels and suitability of the  objects as background continuum sources for extended integrations.  The  data produced from this snapshot survey will be used extensively as part of  program P111 to study the flux distribution and intrinsic absorption  properties of the AGNs and QSOs observed.

Atomic H emissions from the bulge region measured by the  high resolution aperture (HIRS) will determine the dynamics of the bulge  and anti-bulge regions.  The high-throughput aperture will be used to  search for HD fluorescently pumped by solar Lyman-beta as well as to  determine if there is a correlation of the H_2 Lyman and Werner bands with  Lyman-alpha in the bulge region.  The excitation of H_2 in the atmosphere  of Saturn will be similarly studied.  Io Torus emissions will be measured  using the high-throughput aperture (MDRS) to determine ion velocity  profiles and with the large science aperture to search for minor  constituents.

This fraction constrains the HI  opacity and topology of gas layers in the parent galaxy and its halo, and  it gauges the potential contribution of starbursts to the metagalactic  (IGM) radiation field.  A related goal is to use the spectrum longward of  the Lyman limit for better understanding the star, dust and gas content of  the galaxy.'),('P215',2,'Two High-Extinction Stars in the LMC','Shull','Michael','University of Colorado','The fundamental physical and chemical processes at work in molecular clouds are key objects of FUSE science.  Preliminary results on H2 in the LMC, based on available PI Team data, suggest a reduced molecular fraction in the low-metallicity LMC gas.  Although this result provides  the first direct evidence of a metallicity dependence in the formation  rate of interstellar H2, the available FUSE targets do not sample the  high-extinction regime where the correlation between E(B--V) and molecular  fraction is strong.  Therefore, we cannot test whether the apparent  reduction in molecular fraction is due to reduced formation rates, high  radiative destruction rates, or selection effects. We propose observations  of 7 LMC stars and 2 SMC stars with E(B--V) = 0.20 -- 0.42, which will  allow us to test cloud models that incorporate different assumptions about  the formation rate of H2 as a function of metallicity. We will also obtain CO emission maps in these selected regions to assess the CO/H2ratio in this gas.  As a key goal of FUSE H2 science, this test can be applied only to sight lines for which the variation of molecular fraction with extinction can be tightly controlled.'),('P251',2,'D/O ratio toward WD2247+583','Oliveira','Cristina','Johns Hopkins University','I propose to observe the white dwarf WD2247+583 (Lan 23) and measure the D/O ratio along this line of sight. If the O/H ratio is ~ constant as the work of Meyer et al (ref 3) seems to indicate and the D/H is also ~ constant then we would expect that D/O is also ~ constant. Preliminary analysis of several lines of sight using FUSE data have not yet been able to show a definite correlation between N(DI) and N(OI) and so more measurements along different lines of sight are needed. Previous measurements using EUVE data (ref 1) have placed the HI column density at 716 < N(HI) < 1596 x10^17 cm^-2. Using a D/H ratio of 1.2x10^-5 this places the DI column between 8.6 x10^14 and 1.9x10^15 (cm^-2). This will be an interesting measurement since DI is typically measured in lines of sight with low HI column density (N(HI)~10^18 cm ^-2) and we\'ll be probing the D/O ratio in a regime that is not very explored. The effective temperature and gravity of this white dwarf indicates that the stellar continuum will be relatively smooth and continuum placement won\'t be a major uncertainty in measuring N(DI) as is the case with other types of white dwarfs.'),('Q107',1,'H_2 in the Small Magellanic Cloud','Ferlet','','Institut d\'Astrophysique de Paris','The star Sk 143 in the SMC has most peculiar properties: its extinction curve in the far-UV is of Galactic type, contrary to all the other SMC stars which have a small or absent extinction bump and a very strong rise in the extinction at shorter wavelength. It also has an apparently Galactic ratio of E(B-V) to atomic hydrogen column density. Still, the interstellar lines are at the SMC velocity, and suggest that the extinction is due to a molecular cloud in the SMC.  However a deep integration in the CO(1-0) line with the Swedish-ESO submillimeter telescope has given a null result. FUSE will help solve this mystery by observing the H_2 lines and other lines which might yield a detection of the absorbing gas.'),('Q222',2,'The H2 molecular gas in the center of M100','Deleuil,','Magali','Laboratoire Astrophysique de Marseille','We propose to observe the central region of the nearby spiral galaxy M100  in order to properly measure the column density of the molecular  hydrogen gas via its absorption lines  (Lyman and Werner bands).

Rather than multiple peak-ups during a single orbit, only one will be done, and relative FPA motions done based on data from S513 and S514 (as well as other peak-up tests). For this test, only the SiC channels will be moved. Exposures will be time-tag, and examined for changes in count rates.

Previously-observed targets from Cycles 1-5 that are in the public domain have been approved by the FUSE Project Scientist for potential re-observation to increase the target pool in the regions with absolute declinations greater than 50 degrees.  The scientific justifications include a) increasing signal to noise for any previously-observed target by obtaining additional data, and b) (for many targets) providing additional data for investigations of potential time variability.  Point (b) is particularly appropriate for O-B stars with wind lines, but could be applicable to other categories of sources as well.  The program and target IDs were selected to place the targets in order of increasing RA.  Each program thus contains targets from a variety of categories.

Though such systems may in fact be dominate in numerical terms the entire population of cataclysmic variables, this will be the first such system to have been observed in the FUSE wavelength range. We will use the observations is to characterize the accretion disk and wind of this very compact, nearly edge-on system. We will contrast the nature of this disk to that of more \" normal\" dwarf novae that have been observed with FUSE.
