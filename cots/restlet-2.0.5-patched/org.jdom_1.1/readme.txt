JDOM - Solution for using XML as simple as Java itself
------------------------------------------------------

"There is no compelling reason for a Java API to manipulate XML to be 
complex, tricky, unintuitive, or a pain in the neck. JDOMTM is both 
Java-centric and Java-optimized. It behaves like Java, it uses Java 
collections, it is completely natural API for current Java developers, 
and it provides a low-cost entry point for using XML."
